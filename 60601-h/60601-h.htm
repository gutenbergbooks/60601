<p>A number of words in this book have both hyphenated and
non-hyphenated variants. For the words with both variants present the
one more used has been kept.</p>

<p>Obvious punctuation and other printing errors have been
corrected.</p>

<p>The book cover was modified by the Transcriber and has
been put in the public domain.</p>

<p>The Transcriber would like to point out to what are considered a
couple of translation inaccuracies from the original Italian language
version.</p>

<p>In page <a href="#id59">59</a> the text reads:</p>

<p>"I know of no marsh capable of provoking in human pulses a fever more
violent that that which at times steals up to us from the shadows of a
silent canal."</p>

<p>While in the Italian edition (Publisher: Milano Fratelli Treves; year:
1900), the text reads:</p>

<p>"Io non conosco palude capace di provocare in polsi umani una febbre
più violenta di quella che sentimmo talvolta venire verso di noi
all'improvviso dall'ombra di un canale taciturno."</p>

<p>The Transcriber thinks a more adequate translation would be:</p>

<p>"I know of no marsh capable of causing a fever in human pulses more
violent than the one we sometimes hear coming towards us suddenly from
the shadow of a taciturn channel."</p>

<p>In page <a href="#id195">195</a> the text reads:</p>

<p>"He had astonished even himself by that sudden apparition, that
unexpected discovery which illumined the shadows of his mind, because
exterior reality, and almost tangible."</p>

<p>While in the Italian edition the text reads:</p>

<p>"Si stupiva egli medessimo di quell'apparizione subitanea, di quella
improvvisa scoperta che, illuminandosi nell buio del suo spirito si
esternava e quasi diveniva tangibile."</p>

<p>The Transcriber thinks a more adequate translation would be:</p>

<p>"He was surprised himself by that sudden appearance, of that sudden

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Gabriele D'Annunzio, poet, novelist, and
dramatist, was born in 1864, on the yacht <em>Irene</em>
near Pescara in the Abruzzi, his mother being
the Duchess Maria Galesse of Rome. His education
was begun in the College of Prato, in Tuscany,
and finished in the University of Rome. His mind early
showed signs of extraordinary power and brilliant versatility;
he studied art and produced very creditable work
while a mere lad, and at the age of sixteen he published
his first poem, <cite>Primo Vere</cite>, which attracted flattering attention
and caused him to be hailed as an infant prodigy.
In 1880 he went to Rome and became a contributor to
the <cite>Cronaca Bizantina</cite>, a magazine of art and literature.
He remained in Rome three years, producing in that time
<cite>Terra vergine</cite> ("Virgin Soil"), <cite>Canto novo</cite> ("New Song"),
and <cite>Intermezzo di rime</cite> ("Intervals of Rhyme"), all of
which were received with admiration and amazement,
and with not a little criticism for their unconventional
boldness of expression.</p>

<p>D'Annunzio left Rome in 1884 and returned to his native
hills, where he wrote <cite>Il libro delle vergine</cite> ("The
Book of the Virgins") in 1884; <cite>San Pantaleone</cite> (1886),
and <cite>Isottèo Guttadauro</cite>. Then, abandoning his revolutionary
and realistic though splendid and intoxicating poetry
for prose, the young genius next surprised his public
with a novel, <cite>Giovanni Episcopo</cite>, followed by <cite>Il Piacere</cite>
("The Child of Pleasure"), in 1889. The former is a
strong yet repelling story of crude brutalism, told by a
victim of relentless fate; the latter is a kind of poem in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
prose, in which there is something above mere facility of
literary touch; he shows the power of the master poet
or painter to see the world at a glance, and with a dextrous
hand to draw for eyes less keen that world in all
its changeful aspects.</p>

<p>His next important novel, <cite>Il trionfo della morte</cite> ("The
Triumph of Death") was produced in 1896. This brought
upon him a storm of mingled applause and criticism&mdash;admiration
for its marvelous beauty of literary expression,
condemnation of the realistic study of a degenerate whose
sins lead him to suicide. But, with a proud defiance of
criticism, with eyes fixed only on his art, he dared after
this achievement to write the self-revelatory novel that
is known as his masterpiece&mdash;<cite>Il fuoco</cite> ("The Flame").
In this great novel, which may fairly be called unique,
we recognize the personification of a renascence of Latin
genius. Under the thinnest veil of disguise, the author
presents his own figure and that of one of the world's
greatest tragic actresses, revealing the most intimate details
of their well known friendship. On this picture
of the most romantic of love-affairs, in Venice, the most
romantic of cities, he has lavished his finest strokes of
genius, writing of feminine nature with rare truth and
skill, and an exquisite intuition as to the workings of
a woman's mind and the throbbings of her heart.</p>

<p>Besides his poems and novels, D'Annunzio has written
several plays, the best known being <cite>La Gioconda</cite> ("Joy"),
<cite>La Gloria</cite> ("Glory"), <cite>La morta città</cite> ("The City of the
Dead"), and <cite>Francesca da Rimini</cite>. He is unquestionably
the greatest Italian writer of to-day, and few works of
Italian fiction appear that do not show something of his
influence. A European critic of keen discernment says:
"Read his works, all ye men and women for whom life
has no secrets and truth has no terror."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>THE BELLS OF SAN MARCO</small></h2>


<p>"Stelio, does not your heart quail a little,
for the first time?" inquired La Foscarina,
with a fleeting smile, as she touched the
hand of the taciturn friend seated beside
her. "I see that you are pale and thoughtful. Yet this
is a beautiful evening for the triumph of a great poet."</p>

<p>With an all-comprehensive glance, she looked around
at all the beauty of this last twilight of September. In
the dark wells of her eyes were reflected the circles of
light made by the oar as it flashed in the water, which
was illuminated by the glittering angels that shone from
afar on the campaniles of San Marco and San Giorgio
Maggiore.</p>

<p>"As always," she went on, in her sweetest tones, "as
always, everything is in your favor. On such an evening
as this, what mortal could shut out from his mind the
dreams that you may choose to evoke by the magic of
your words? Do you not feel already that the multitude
is well disposed to receive your revelation?"</p>

<p>Thus, delicately, she flattered her friend; thus she
pleased herself by exalting him with continual praise.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to imagine a more magnificent and
unique festival than this, to persuade so disdainful a
poet as you to come forth from his ivory tower. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
you was reserved this rare joy; to communicate for the
first time with the people in a sovereign place like the
Hall of the Greater Council, from the platform where
once the Doge harangued the assembled patricians, with
the <cite>Paradiso</cite> of Tintoretto for a background, and overhead
the <cite>Gloria</cite> of Veronese."</p>

<p>Stelio Effrena looked long and searchingly into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to intoxicate me?" he said, with a
sudden laugh. "Your words remind me of the soothing
cup offered to a man on his way to the scaffold. Ah,
well, my friend, it is true: I own that my heart quails
a little."</p>

<p>The sound of applause rose from the Traghetto di San
Gregorio, echoed through the Grand Canal, reverberating
among the porphyry and serpentine discs ornamenting
the ancient mansion of the Dario, which now leaned
over slightly, like a decrepit courtesan loaded with her
jewels.</p>

<p>The royal barge passed.</p>

<p>"There is the one person among your audience
whom etiquette demands that you shall crown with some
of your flowers of oratory," pursued the charming flatterer,
alluding to the Queen. "I believe that, in one of
your earlier books, you own to a taste and respect for
ceremonials. One of your most extraordinary flights of
fancy is that description of a day of Charles the Second,
King of Spain."</p>

<p>When the royal barge passed the gondola, the man
and the woman saluted it. The Queen, recognizing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
poet, the author of <cite>Persephone</cite>, and the distinguished
tragic actress, turned to gaze at them with a movement
of instinctive curiosity. She was blonde and rosy, and
her face was lighted by her ever-ready smile, as she
looked out from the cloud of creamy Buranesi laces
clinging around her shoulders. Beside her sat Andriana
Duodo, the patroness of Burano, where, on that industrious
little island, she cultivated flax, and raised the
most marvelous old-fashioned flowers.</p>

<p>"Does it not seem to you that the smiles of those two
women are so similar as to be twin-like?" said La Foscarina,
gazing at the silvery ripples in the wake of the
barge, wherein the double light seemed to prolong its
self.</p>

<p>"The Countess has a magnificent and ingenuous soul&mdash;one
of those rare Venetian spirits that preserve their
warmth, as their ancient paintings retain their vivid
color," said Stelio, earnestly, as if in gratitude. "I have
an absolute devotion for her sensitive hands. They fairly
quiver with pleasure when they touch rare lace or rich
velvet, lingering over the texture with a grace that seems
almost shy of betraying such voluptuous joy in mere
touch. One day, when I had accompanied her to the
gallery of the Academia, she stopped before the <cite>Massacre
des Innocents</cite> by the first Bonifazio. You recollect, of
course, the green robe of the prostrate woman that one
of Herod's soldiers is about to kill&mdash;a thing impossible to
forget! She paused long before it, seeming fairly to
radiate from her own person the perfect joy that filled
her senses; then she said to me, 'Let us leave this place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
now, Effrena! Take me away, but I must leave my eyes
on that robe&mdash;I cannot look at anything more!' Ah, do
not smile at her, dear friend! She was perfectly simple
and sincere in saying that: she really did leave her spiritual
vision behind her on that bit of canvas which Art,
with a touch of color, has made the center of an infinitely
pleasurable mystery. Besides, it was really a blind
woman that I accompanied there, but I was suddenly
seized with reverence for the privileged soul for whom
the magic of color had power to abolish for the moment
all memory of commonplace life, and to cut off all other
worldly communication. What should you call such a
state of mind? A filling of life's goblet to the brim, it
seems to me. It is exactly what I should like to do
to-night, if I were not discouraged."</p>

<p>A new clamor, louder and more prolonged, rose between
the two guardian columns of granite, as the royal
barge approached the bank of the Piazzetta, now black
with the waiting throng. During the slight pause that
followed, the movement of the crowd shifted, like the
changing of eddies in a current, and all the galleries
of the Palace of the Doges were filled with a confused
buzzing, like the mysterious murmur within a sea-shell.
Suddenly the buzz rose to a shout, rending the
clear air and finally dying away in the gathering twilight.
The multitude seemed to realize the divinity of that
poetic hour, amid those incomparable surroundings; and
perhaps, in its acclaim to youthful royalty and beauty,
it expressed a vague longing to forget its prosaic existence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and to revel in the gift of eternal poetry with
which its storied walls and waters were endowed.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Perdita," Stelio suddenly exclaimed,
"of any other place in the world that possesses, like
Venice, at certain times, the power to stimulate all the
forces of human life by the exaltation of all desires to a
feverish intensity? Do you know of any more irresistible
temptress?"</p>

<p>She whom he called Perdita did not reply; she bent her
head as if from desire to concentrate her thoughts; but
through all her being she felt the indefinable thrill always
felt at the sound of the voice of her friend when it
revealed the vehemence and passionate soul toward
which this woman was drawn by a mingling of love
and terror that had no limit.</p>

<p>"Peace! Oblivion! Do you find them down there,
at the end of that deserted canal, when you go home
exhausted and fevered after inhaling the commingled
breath of the crowd that you are able to rouse to wild
enthusiasm by a single gesture? As for myself, when I
float on these dead waters, I feel my vital powers increase
with bewildering rapidity; at certain times my
brain seems on fire, as if I were in delirium."</p>

<p>"The flame and the power are within yourself, Stelio,"
said La Foscarina almost humbly, without raising her
eyes.</p>

<p>He was silent, absorbed. Poetic imagery and impetuous
music took form within his brain, as if by virtue
of some magic fecundation; and his spirit reveled in the
unexpected delight of that flood of inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>It was still that hour which, in one of his books, he
had called "Titian's hour," because all things glowed
with a rich golden light, like the nude figures of that
great painter, appearing almost to illumine the sky
rather than to receive light from it.</p>

<p>"Perdita," said the poet, who, at the sight of so many
things multiplying their beauties around him, was conscious
of a kind of intellectual ecstasy, "does it not seem
to you that we are following the funeral train of the
dead Summer? There she lies in her funereal barge,
robed in golden draperies, like a Doge's wife, like a
Loredana, a Morosina, or a Soranza of the golden age;
and her cortège conducts her toward the Isle of Murano,
where some lord of the flames will place her in a coffin
of opaline crystal, so that, submerged in the waters
of the lagoon, she can, at least, through her transparent
eyelids, behold the supple movement of the seaweed,
and thus fancy herself enwrapped in the undulating
tresses of her own hair, while waiting for the sun of
resurrection to dawn."</p>

<p>A spontaneous smile spread over La Foscarina's face,
born in her eyes, which glowed as if they really had beheld
the vision of the beautiful dead.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Perdita," resumed Stelio, after a moment's
pause, during which both gazed at a file of small
boats filled with fruit, floating upon the water like great
baskets, "do you know anything about a particularly
pretty detail in the chronicles of the Doges? The Doge's
wife, to meet the expenses of her robes of ceremony, enjoyed
a certain percentage of the tax on fruit. Does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
this seem delightfully appropriate? The fruits of these
isles clothed her in gold and crowned her with pearls!
Pomona paying tribute to Arachne! an allegory that Paolo
Veronese might well have painted on the dome of the
Vestiario. When I conjure up the figure of the noble
lady, tall and erect in her high, jeweled buskins, it pleases
me to think that something fresh and rustic is connected
with the rich folds of her heavy brocade: the tribute of
the fruits. What a savor this seems to add to her magnificence!
Only fancy, my friend, that these figs and
grapes of the new-come Autumn are the price of the
golden robe that covers the dead Summer."</p>

<p>"What delightful fancies, Stelio!" said La Foscarina,
whose face became young again when she smiled, as a
child to whom one shows a picture-book. "Who was it
that once called you the Image-maker?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;images!" said the poet, his fancy warming. "In
Venice, just as one feels everything to a musical rhythm,
so he thinks of everything in poetic imagery. They come
to us from everywhere, innumerable, diverse, more real
and living to our minds than the persons we elbow in
these narrow streets. In studying them, we can lose
ourselves in the depths of their haunting eyes, and divine,
by the curve of their lips, what they would say to us.
Some art tyrannical as imperious mistresses, and hold us
long beneath the yoke of their power. Others are enfolded
in a veil, like timid virgins, or are tightly swaddled,
like infants; and only he that knows how to rend
their veils can lead them to the perfect life. This morning,
when I awakened, my soul was filled with images;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
it was like a beautiful tree with its branches laden with
chrysalides."</p>

<p>He paused, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"If they come forth from their prison to-night," he
added, "I am saved; if they do not, I am lost!"</p>

<p>"Lost?" said La Foscarina, gazing earnestly at him,
with eyes so full of confidence that his heart went out
to her in gratitude. "No, Stelio, you will not lose yourself.
You are always sure of yourself; you bear your
own destiny in your hands. I think your mother never
could have felt any apprehension on your account, even
in the most serious circumstances. Is not that true?
Pride is the only thing that makes your heart falter."</p>

<p>"Ah, sweet friend, how I love you&mdash;how I thank you
for saying that!" said the poet frankly, taking her hand.
"You continually foster my pride and encourage me to
believe that I have already acquired those virtues to
which I never cease to aspire. Sometimes you seem to
have the power of conferring I know not what divine
quality on the things that are born in my soul, and of
making them appear adorable in my own eyes. Sometimes,
too, you fill me with the awe-struck wonder of
the sculptor who, having in the evening borne to the
sacred temple the marble gods still warm from his hands&mdash;I
might say still clinging to the fingers that moulded
them&mdash;the next day beholds them standing on their
pedestals, surrounded by clouds of incense, and seeming
to exhale divinity from every pore of the insensate matter
from which he fashioned them with his perishable hands.
And so, each time that Fortune grants me the favor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
being near you, I realize that you are necessary to my
life, although, during our long separations, I can live
without you, and you without me, despite the fact that
both of us well know what splendors would be born
of the perfect union of our lives. Thus, knowing the
full value of that which you give me, and, still more,
of that which you could give me, I think of you as lost to
me; and, by that name which it pleases my fancy to
call you, I try to express at the same time this consciousness
and this regret."</p>

<p>He interrupted himself, because he felt a quiver of the
hand he clasped in his own.</p>

<p>"When I call you 'Perdita,'" he resumed softly, after
a pause, "I fancy that you can see my desire approaching
you, with a deadly blade deep in its palpitating side.
Even should it reach you, the chill of death has already
touched its audacious hand."</p>

<p>The woman experienced an oft-felt suffering as she
listened to the poetic words that flowed from her friend's
lips with a spontaneity that proved them sincere. Again
she felt an agitation and a terror that she knew not how
to define. She felt that she was slipping out of her own
life, and was transported into a kind of fictitious life,
intense and hallucinating, where even to breathe was
difficult. Drawn into that atmosphere, as fiery as the
glow surrounding a lighted forge, she felt that she should
be capable of passing through any transfigurations that
it might please the master of her spirit to work in her
to satisfy his continual craving for poetry and beauty.
She comprehended that, in his idealistic mind, her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
image resembled that of the dead Summer, wrapped in
its opalescent cerements. She felt a childish desire to
gaze into the poet's eyes as in a mirror, to contemplate
the likeness of her real self.</p>

<p>That which rendered her melancholy most painful,
was the recognition of a vague resemblance between
this agitation and the anxiety that always possessed her
when she sank her own personality in that of some
sublime creation of dramatic art. Was not this man
drawing her, in fact, into a similar region of higher but
artificial life; and, that she might figure there without
remembrance of her everyday self, did he not seek to
cover her with a splendid disguise? But, while she was
unable to maintain so great a degree of intensity except
by a painful effort, she knew that he dwelt within that
state of exaltation with perfect ease, as if in his natural
atmosphere, ceaselessly enjoying a marvelous world of
fancy, which he could renew or change at his own
pleasure.</p>

<p>He had come to realize in himself the intimate union of
art and of life, thus finding, in the depths of his own
soul, a source of perpetual harmony. He had become
able to maintain within himself, without lapse, the mysterious
psychological condition that engenders works of
beauty, and thus, at a single stroke, to crystallize into
ideal types the fleeting figures of his varied existence.
It was to celebrate this conquest over his own mental
powers that he put the following words into the mouth
of one of his heroes: "I witnessed within myself the
continual genesis of a higher life, wherein all appearances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
metamorphosed themselves as if reflected in a
magic mirror." Endowed with an extraordinary linguistic
facility, he could instantly translate into words the
most complicated workings of his mind, with a precision
so exact and vivid that sometimes, as soon as expressed,
they seemed not to be his own, having been rendered
objective by the isolating power of style. His clear and
penetrating voice, which, so to speak, seemed to define
each word as distinctly as if it were a note of music, enhanced
still more this peculiar quality of his speech, so
that those who heard him speak for the first time experienced
an ambiguous feeling&mdash;a mingling of admiration
and aversion, because he revealed his own personality
in a manner so strongly marked that it seemed to denote
an intention to demonstrate the existence of a profound
and impassable difference between himself and
his listeners. But as his sensibility equaled his intelligence,
it was easy for those that knew him well and liked
him to absorb, through his crystalline speech, the glow of
his vehement and passionate soul. These knew how illimitable
was his power to feel and to dream, and from
what fiery source sprang the beautiful images into which
he converted the substance of his inner life.</p>

<p>She whom he called Perdita knew it well; and, as a
pious soul awaits from God some supernatural help
that shall work out its salvation, so she seemed to be
waiting for him to put her into the state of grace necessary
to enable her to elevate and maintain herself in those
fiery regions toward which a mad desire to be consumed
impelled her, despairing as she was at the thought of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
vanished youth, and the fear of finding herself left alone
at last in a desert of ashes.</p>

<p>"It is you now, Stelio," she said, with the slight smile
she used to hide her sadness, "who wish to intoxicate
me." She gently drew her hand from his. Then, to break
the spell, she pointed to a loaded barge that was slowly
approaching them, and said:</p>

<p>"Look! Look at your pomegranates!"</p>

<p>But her voice shook a little.</p>

<p>Then, in the dreamy twilight, on the water as silvery-green
as the leaves of the willow, they watched the passing
boat overflowing with that emblematic fruit which
suggests things rich and hidden: caskets of red leather,
surmounted by the crown of a royal donor; some closed,
others half-open, revealing their close-packed gems.</p>

<p>In a low tone, the tragic actress repeated the words
addressed by Hades to Persephone in the sacred drama,
at the moment when the daughter of Demeter tastes the
fatal pomegranate:</p>

<p class="indent">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Quando tu coglierai il colchico in fiore su'l molle<br />
Prato terrestre, presso la madre dal cerulo peplo.</i></p>

<p>"Ah, Perdita! how well you know how to throw a shadow
into your voice!" interrupted the poet, feeling the
harmony of the twilight that seemed to throw a mystic
vagueness over the syllables of his lines. "How well you
know how to become nocturnal, even before the evening
is upon us! Do you recall the scene where Persephone
is on the point of throwing herself into Erebus, to the
wailing of the chorus of the Oceanides? Her face is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
like yours when a shadow passes over it. Her crowned
head leans backward, as she stands rigidly erect in her
saffron-colored peplum; and the very spirit of the night
seems flowing into her bloodless flesh, deepening under
her chin, in the hollows of her eyes and around her nostrils,
giving her face the look of a tragic mask. It
is your mask, Perdita! While I was composing my
<cite>Mystery</cite>, the remembrance of you aided me in evoking her
divine person. That little saffron-velvet ribbon you so
often wear around your neck gave me the note for
Persephone's peplum. And one evening at your house,
when I was about to take leave of you at the threshold
of a room where the lamps were not yet lighted&mdash;an agitated
evening of last autumn, you remember?&mdash;you succeeded,
with a single movement, in bringing to full light
in my being the creature that had lain long there undeveloped;
and then, without dreaming that you had
brought about that sudden birth, you shut yourself
again within the solitary obscurity of your own Erebus.
Ah, I was certain that I could hear you sob, yet a torrent
of uncontrollable joy ran through my veins. I never
have spoken to you of this before, have I? I ought to
have consecrated my work to you, as to an ideal Lucina."</p>

<p>She shrank under the eyes of the master of her spirit;
she suffered because of that mask which he admired
on her face, and because of that strange joy that she was
aware was continually up-springing within him, like a
perpetually playing fountain. She felt oppressed by her
own personality; troubled because of her too-expressive
face, the muscles of which possessed a strange power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of mimicry; pained to think of that involuntary art which
governed the significance of her gestures, and of
that expressive shadow which sometimes on the
stage, during a moment of anxious silence, she knew
how to throw over her face like a veil of grief&mdash;that
shadow which now threatened to remain among the lines
traced by time on the face that was no longer young.
She suffered cruelly by the hand she adored&mdash;that hand
so delicate and noble which, even with a gift or a caress,
had power to hurt her.</p>

<p>"Do you not believe, Perdita," Stelio continued after
another pause, "in the occult beneficence of signs? I do
not mean astral science or horoscopic signs. I mean
that, like those that believe themselves under the influence
of one planet or another, we can create an ideal
correspondence between our own soul and some terrestrial
object, in such a way that this object, becoming
impregnated, little by little, with the essence of
ourselves, and being magnified by our illusion,
finally becomes for us the representative sign of our
unknown destiny, and takes on an aspect of mystery
when it appears to us in certain crises of our life.
This is the secret whereby we may restore to our withering
hearts something of their pristine freshness. I know
by experience the beneficial effect we may derive from
intense communion with some earthly object. From
time to time it is necessary for our natures to become
like a hamadryad, in order to feel within us the circulation
of new energy drawn from the source of life. Of
course you understand that I am thinking of your words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
just now, when the boat passed. You expressed the same
idea when you said 'Look at your pomegranates!' For
you, and for everyone that loves me, the pomegranate
never can be anything but <em>mine</em>. For you and for them,
the idea of my personality is indissolubly linked to that
fruit which I have chosen for an emblem, and which I
have charged with significant ideals, more numerous
than its seeds. Had I lived in the times when men excavated
the Grecian marbles and found under the soil
the still damp roots of ancient fables, no painter could
have represented me on his canvas without putting in
my hand the Punic apple. To sever from my person
that symbol would have seemed to the ingenuous artist
like the amputation of a living member, for, to his pagan
imagination, the fruit would have seemed to grow to my
hand as to its natural branch. In short, he would not
have conceived me in any different way than he thought
of Hyacinthus or Narcissus or Ciparissus, all three of
whom would appear to him as youths symbolized by a
plant. But, even in our day, a few lively and warm
imaginations exist that comprehend all the meaning and
enjoy all the savor of my invention.</p>

<p>"You, yourself, Perdita, do you not delight in cultivating
in your garden a pomegranate, the beautiful
'Effrenian' tree, that you may every summer watch
me blossom and bring forth fruit? In one of your letters,
flying to me like a winged messenger, you described to
me the graceful ceremony of decorating the tree with
garlands the day you received the first copy of <cite>Persephone</cite>.
So, for you, and for those that love me, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in reality renewed an ancient myth when, in fancy, I
have assimilated myself with a form of eternal Nature.
And when I am dead (and may Nature grant that I am
able to manifest my whole self in my work before I
die!), my disciples will honor me under a symbol of that
tree; and in the sharp outline of the leaf, in the flame
of the flower, and in the hidden treasure of the ripe fruit,
they will recognize certain qualities of my art. By
that leaf, by that flower and fruit, as if by a posthumous
teaching of the master, their minds will be formed to
a similar sharpness, flame-like intensity, and treasured
richness.</p>

<p>"You will see now, Perdita, what is the real beneficence
of symbols. By affinity, I am led to develop
myself in accord with the magnificent genius of the plant
which it pleases me to fancy as the symbol of my aspirations
toward a full, rich life. This arboreous
image of myself suffices to assure me that my powers
should follow nature in order to attain naturally the end
for which they were created. 'Nature has disposed me
thus' is the epigraph of Leonardo da Vinci, which I
placed on the title-page of my first book; and the pomegranate,
as it continually blossoms and bears its fruit,
repeats to me that simple phrase over and over again.
We obey only the laws written in our own substance,
and by reason of this we shall remain intact in the midst
of dissolution, in the unity and plenitude that make our
joy. No discord exists between my art and my life."</p>

<p>He spoke with perfect freedom, as if the mind of the
listening woman were a chalice into which he poured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
his thoughts till it was full to the brim. An intellectual
felicity filled him, blended with a vague consciousness
of the mysterious action whereby his mind was preparing
itself for the effort it was soon to make. From time
to time, as if by a lightning flash, his mental vision beheld,
as he bent toward his beloved friend and listened
to the beat of the oar in the silence of the great estuary,
the crowd, with its thousand faces, gathering in the vast
hall; and he felt a rapid throbbing of his heart.</p>

<p>"It is a very singular thing, Perdita," said he, gazing
at the pale distance of the waters, "to observe how readily
chance aids our imagination in ascribing an element
of mystery to the conjunction of certain appearances with
the aim we have fancied. I do not understand the reason
why the poets of to-day are so indignant at the vulgarity
of the present, and complain that they were born
either too late or too early. I am convinced that to-day,
as always, every man of intelligence has power to create
for himself his own beautiful fable of life. We should
study the confused whirl of life with the same lively
imagination that Leonardo encouraged in his disciples
when he advised them to study the stains on the wall,
the ashes on the hearth, the clouds, even mud, and similar
objects, in order to find there 'wonderful inventions'
and 'infinite things.' In the same way, he declared, one
can find in the sound of bells every name and every word
that can be imagined. That great master knew well that
chance&mdash;as the sponge of Apelles had already shown&mdash;is
always the friend of the ingenious artist. For example,
I never cease to be astonished at the ease and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
grace with which chance favors the harmonious development
of my inventions. Do you not believe that the dark
god Hades forced his bride to eat the seven seeds of the
pomegranate in order to furnish me with the subject of
a masterpiece?"</p>

<p>He interrupted himself with one of the bursts of boyish
laughter that revealed so clearly the persistence of
natural joyousness in the depths of his heart.</p>

<p>"See, Perdita," he continued, still laughing, "whether
I am not right. Early in October last year I was invited
to Burano by Donna Andriana Duodo. We passed
the morning in her flax-fields, and in the afternoon we
went to visit Torcello. At that time I was beginning
to saturate myself with the mythical story of Persephone,
and already my poem had begun to take shape in
my brain, and it seemed to me that I was floating on
the waters of the Styx, and that I should arrive at the
abode of the Manes. Never had I experienced a purer
and sweeter understanding of death, and this feeling
seemed to render me so ethereal that I fancied I could
tread the field of asphodel without leaving there the
least trace of my footsteps. The air was damp, warm,
the sky was gray; the canals wound between the banks
covered with half-faded verdure. (You know Torcello
only by sunlight, perhaps.) But all this time some one
was talking, arguing, and declaiming in Charon's boat.
The sound of praise roused me from my reverie. Francesco
di Lizo was speaking of me, regretting that such
an artist, so magnificently sensual&mdash;I quote his own
words&mdash;should be obliged to live apart from the obtuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and hostile throng, and to celebrate the feast of sound,
color, and form in the solitary palace of his dream. He
abandoned himself to a lyric impulse, recalling the joyous
and splendid life of the Venetian painters, the popular
favor that swept them, like a whirlwind, up to the
heights of the glory, beauty, strength and joy which
they multiplied around them in producing countless images
on walls and domes.</p>

<p>"Then Donna Andriana said: 'Well, I promise solemnly
that Stelio Effrena shall have his triumphal feast
in Venice.' The Dogaressa had spoken! At that moment
I beheld, on the low, mossy bank, a pomegranate
laden with fruit, which, like the hallucination of a vision,
broke the infinite squalor of that place. Donna Orsetta
Contarini, who was sitting beside me, uttered a cry of
delight, and held out her hands, as impatient as her
lips. Nothing pleases me so much as a frank, strong expression
of desire. 'I adore pomegranates!' she cried,
and she seemed fairly to be tasting its fine, sharp flavor.
She was as childish as her name is archaic. Her cry
moved me; but Andrea Contarini appeared severely to
disapprove of his wife's vivacity. He seemed to me
like a Hades that has little faith in the mnemonic virtue
of the seven seeds as applied to legitimate marriage. But
the boatmen, too, were stirred with sympathy, and rowed
toward the shore, approaching it so close that I was
able to jump out first, and I began at once to despoil
the tree, my brother. It was another case, albeit from
the lips of a pagan of the words of the Last Supper:
'Take, eat, this is my body, which is given for you. Do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
this in remembrance of me.' How does this seem to
you, Perdita? Do not think that I am inventing this
story. I assure you it is true."</p>

<p>La Foscarina allowed herself to be fascinated by the
free and elegant fancy whereby he exercised the quickness
of his wit and his facility of expression. In his
words was something intoxicating, variable, and vigorous,
which suggested to her mind the double and diverse
image of water and of fire.</p>

<p>"Now," he continued, "Donna Andriana has kept her
promise. Guided by that hereditary taste for magnificence
which she shows so plainly, she has prepared
a truly ducal feast in the Palace of the Doges, in imitation
of those that were held there toward the end of
the sixteenth century. She conceived the idea of rescuing
from oblivion the <cite>Ariadne</cite> of Benedetto Marcello,
and of making her sigh in the same place where Tintoretto
painted the daughter of Minos receiving the crown
of stars from Aphrodite. Don't you recognize in the
beauty of this idea the woman who wished to leave her
dear eyes behind her on that ineffable green robe? Remember,
too, that this <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">musicale</i> in the Hall of the Greater
Council has a historic precedent. In fifteen hundred
seventy-three, in this same Hall, was performed a
mythological composition by Cornelio Frangipani, with
music by Claudio Merulo, in honor of his most Christian
Majesty Henry Third. Own, Perdita, that my erudition
astonishes you. Ah, if you only knew all that I
have learned on that subject! I will read you my lecture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
on it, some day when you deserve a severe punishment!"</p>

<p>"What! Are you not to read it to-night at the festival?"
inquired La Foscarina in surprise, fearing that,
with his well known heedlessness of engagements, Effrena
had resolved to disappoint the expectant public.</p>

<p>He understood her anxiety, and chose to amuse himself
with it.</p>

<p>"This evening," he replied, with tranquil assurance,
"I shall take a sherbet in your garden, and delight my
eyes with the sight of the pomegranate, with its jewels
gleaming in the starlight."</p>

<p>"Ah, Stelio! What do you mean?" she cried, half
rising.</p>

<p>In her words and movement was so keen a regret, and
at the same time so strange an evocation of the expectant
gathering, that his mind was troubled. The image
of the formidable monster with innumerable human
faces amid the gold and somber purple of the vast hall
reappeared before his mental vision; in fancy he felt its
fixed regard and hot breath. He realized also the peril
he had resolved to face in trusting only to the inspiration
of the moment, and felt a horror of a possible sudden
mental obscurity, an unexpected confusion of his
thought.</p>

<p>"Reassure yourself," he said. "I was only jesting. I
will go <em>ad bestias</em>, and I will go unarmed. Did you not
see the sign reappear just now? Do you believe, after
the miracle of Torcello, that it reappeared in vain? It
has come to warn me again that the only attitude that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
suits me is the one to which Nature disposes me. Now,
you well know, my friend, that I do not know how to
speak of anything but myself. And so, from the throne
of the Doges, I must speak to my listeners only of my
own soul, under the veil of some seductive allegory,
with the charm of flowing musical cadences. I purpose
to do this extemporaneously, if the fiery spirit of Tintoretto
will only inspire me, from the heights of his
Paradise, with sufficient ardor and audacity. The risk
tempts me. But into what a strange error I was about
to fall, Perdita! When the Dogaressa announced the
feast to me, and begged me to do the honors, I undertook
to compose a dignified discourse, a really ceremonious
effort in prose, ample and solemn as one of
those great robes of state behind glass in the Correr
Museum; not without making in the exordium a profound
genuflexion to the Queen; nor omitting to weave an
impressive garland for the head of the most serene Andriana
Duodo! And for several days it has given me
a curious pleasure to dwell in spiritual communion with
a Venetian patrician of the sixteenth century, a master
of letters like Cardinal Bembo, a member of the Academy
Uracini or Adorni, a frequent visitor to the gardens
of Murano and the hills of Asolo. Certain it is that I
felt a marked resemblance between the turn of my periods
and the massive gold frames that surround the paintings
on the ceiling of the Hall of Council. But, alas!
yesterday morning, when I arrived here, and, in passing
along the Grand Canal, when I wished to steep my
weariness in the damp, transparent shade where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
marble still exhales the spirit of the night, I had a sudden
impression that my papers were worth much less than
the dead seaweed tossed by the tide, and they seemed
as strange to me as the <cite>Trionfi</cite> of Celio Magno and the
<cite>Favole Marittime</cite> of Anton Maria Consalvi, quoted and
commented on in them by me. What should I do, then?"</p>

<p>He threw around him an all-sweeping glance, as if exploring
the waters and the sky in search of an invisible
presence, or a newly arrived phantom. A yellowish light
spread toward the solitary shores, which stood out in
sharp lines like the dark veins in agate. Behind him,
toward the Salute, the sky was scattered with light rosy
and violet ribbon-like clouds, giving it the appearance of
a glaucous sea, peopled with Medusas. From the gardens
near the water descended the odor of foliage saturated
with light and heat&mdash;an odor so heavy one might
almost see it float on the waves like aromatic oil.</p>

<p>"Do you feel the Autumn, Perdita?" Stelio asked his
dreamy friend, in a penetrating voice.</p>

<p>Again she had a vision of the dead Summer, enclosed
within opalescent glass and sunk among the masses of
seaweed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I feel it&mdash;within myself!" she replied, with a
melancholy smile.</p>

<p>"Did you not see it last night, when it descended
upon the city? Where were you last night, at sunset?"</p>

<p>"In a garden of the Giudecca."</p>

<p>"I was here, on the Riva. When human eyes have
contemplated such a spectacle of joy and beauty, does
it not seem to you that the eyelids should close and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
seal themselves forever? I should like to speak to-night,
Perdita, of these hidden, secret matters. I should like to
celebrate within myself the nuptials of Venice and Autumn,
in almost the same tonality that Tintoretto used
when he painted the nuptials of Ariadne and Bacchus
for the hall of the Anticollegio&mdash;azure, purple and gold.
Last night an old germ of poetry suddenly blossomed
in my soul. I recalled a fragment of a forgotten poem
that I wrote when I began to write in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nona rima</i>, one
September in my early youth, when I had come by sea
to Venice for the first time. The title of the poem was
simply 'The Allegory of Autumn,' and the god was no
longer represented as crowned with vine-leaves, but with
jewels, like one of Paolo Veronese's princes, his being
aglow with passion, about to approach the Anadyomenean
City, with her arms of marble and her thousand
green girdles. But the idea had not at that time reached
the right degree of intensity to be admitted to the
realm of Art, and instinctively I gave up the effort to
manifest it in its entirety. But, in an active mind, as
in a fertile soil, no seed is lost; and now this idea returns
to me at an opportune moment and urgently demands
expression. What a just and mysterious fatality
governs the mental world! It was necessary that I
should respect that first germ in order to feel its multiplied
virtues develop in me to-day. That Vinci, who
looked deep into all things profound, certainly meant
something of this kind in his fable of the grain of millet
that says to the ant: 'If you will be kind enough to
let me satisfy my desire to be born again, I will render
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
myself to you again a hundredfold.' Admire the touch of
grace in those fingers capable of breaking iron! Ah, he
is always the incomparable master! How can I forget
him for a time, that I may give myself to the Venetians?"</p>

<p>The playful irony with which he had been speaking
was suddenly extinguished in his last words, and again
he seemed plunged in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"It is already late; the hour approaches; we must return,"
he said presently, rousing himself as if from a
troubled dream, for he had seen reappear that formidable
monster with the thousand human faces filling the depth
and width of the great hall. "I must go back to the
hotel in time to dress."</p>

<p>Then, with a return of his boyish vanity, he thought
of the eyes of the unknown women who would see him
that evening for the first time.</p>

<p>"To the Hotel Danieli," La Foscarina said to the boatman.</p>

<p>While the dentellated iron of the prow swung around
on the water, with a slow, animal-like movement, each
felt a sadness different but equally painful at leaving behind
them the infinite silence of the estuary, already
overcome by darkness and death, and being compelled to
return toward the magnificent and tempting city, whose
canals, like the veins of a full-blooded woman, began
to burn with the fever of night.</p>

<p>They were quiet for some time, absorbed by their interior
agitation, which shook each heart to it depths.
And all things around them exalted the power of life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in the man who wished to attract to himself the universe
in order not to die, and in the woman, who would
have thrown her oppressed soul to the flames in order
to die pure.</p>

<p>Both started at the unexpected sound of the salute at
the lowering of the flag on board a man-of-war anchored
before the gardens. At the summit of the black mass
they saw the tricolored flag slide down the staff and fold
itself up, like a heroic dream that suddenly vanishes.
For a moment the silence seemed deeper, and the gondola
glided into darker shadows, grazing the side of
the armed colossus.</p>

<p>"Do you know that Donatella Arvale who is to sing
in <cite>Ariadne</cite>?" said Stelio suddenly.</p>

<p>"She is the daughter of the great sculptor, Lorenzo
Arvale," La Foscarina replied, after an instant of hesitation.
"I have no dearer friend than she&mdash;and in fact
she is my guest at present. You will meet her at my
house this evening, after the festival."</p>

<p>"Donna Andriana spoke to me of her last night as
a prodigy. She said that the idea of resurrecting <cite>Ariadne</cite>
had come to her on hearing Donatella Arvale sing divinely
the air: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Come mai puoi&mdash;Vedermi piangere?</i> We
shall have some divine music at your house, Perdita.
Oh, how I long to hear it! Below there, in my solitude,
for months and months, I hear only the music of the sea,
which is too terrible, and my own music, which is too
tumultuous."</p>

<p>The bells of San Marco gave the signal for the Angelus,
and their powerful notes spread in great waves of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
sound over the water, vibrating among the masts of the
vessels, and creeping out upon the infinite reach of the
lagoon. From San Giorgio Maggiore, San Giorgio dei
Greci, San Giorgio degli Schiavoni, San Giovanni in Bragora,
and San Moisé, from the Salute, the Redentore,
and beyond, over the entire domain of the Evangelista,
to the distant towers of the Madonna dell' Orto, San
Giobbe and Sant' Andrea, tongues of bronze responded,
mingling in one great chorus, seeming to extend over
the silent stones and waters a single immense and invisible
dome of metal, the vibration of which might almost
reach the first sparkling stars. Those sacred voices
seemed to lend to the City of Silence an ideal and infinite
grandeur.</p>

<p>"Can you still pray?" said Stelio in a softened voice,
looking at the woman who, with eyes downcast, and
hands clasped on her knees, seemed absorbed in a silent
orison.</p>

<p>She did not reply; she only pressed her lips together
more closely.</p>

<p>The minds of both were confused by the strange, the
new image, and the new name, that had risen between
them. Perturbation and passion seized them again, drew
them near each other with such force that they dared
not look into each other's eyes, for fear of what might
be read there.</p>

<p>"Shall I see you again this evening, after the festival?"
said La Foscarina, with a slight unsteadiness in her
voice. "Are you free?"</p>

<p>She was eager now to hold him, to make him her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
prisoner, as if she feared he would escape her, as if she
had hoped to find this night some magic philter that
would bind him to her forever. And, though she comprehended
now that the gift of all she had to give had
become necessary, she realized only too clearly, nevertheless,
even through the intoxication that bewildered
her, the poverty of the gift so long withheld. And a
mournful modesty, a mingling of terror and pride, contracted
her slender frame.</p>

<p>"I am free&mdash;and I am yours!" the young man answered
in a half whisper, without raising his eyes to
hers. "You know that nothing is worth to me what you
can give."</p>

<p>His heart, too, was stirred to its depths, with the two
aims before his ambition toward which, this night, all
his energy bent, like a powerful bow: the city and the
woman, both tempting and mysterious, weary with having
lived too much, and oppressed with too many loves;
both were too much magnified by his imagination, and
both were destined to disappoint his hopes.</p>

<p>In the moment that followed, a violent wave of mingled
regret and desire swept over him. The pride and intoxication
of his hard, persistent labor; his boundless ambition,
which had been curbed within a sphere too narrow
for it; his intolerance of mediocrity, his demand for
the privileges of princes; his superb and empurpled
dreams; his insatiable need of preëminence, glory, pleasure&mdash;surged
in his soul with a confusing tumult, dazzling
and suffocating him. And the craving of his sadness
inclined him to win the final love of this solitary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
nomadic woman, the very folds of whose garments
seemed to suggest the frenzy of the far-off multitudes,
whom she had so often thrilled and shaken with her
art, by a cry of passion, a sob of grief, or a death-like
silence. An irresistible impulse drew him toward this
woman, in whom he fancied he saw the traces of all
emotions and experiences, toward that being, no longer
young, who had known so many caresses, yet was unknown
by him.</p>

<p>"Is it a promise?" he murmured, bowing his head
lower to conceal his agitation. "Ah! at last!"</p>

<p>She made no reply, but fixed on him a gaze of almost
mad intensity, which he did not see.</p>

<p>They relapsed into silence again, while the reverberation
of the bells passing overhead was so penetrating
that they felt it in the roots of the hair, as from a quiver
of their own flesh.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said La Foscarina, as they were landing.
"When we leave the hall, let us meet in the courtyard,
near the second well, the nearest to the Molo."</p>

<p>"Good-by," he answered. "Take some place where I
may see you, among the crowd, when I speak my first
word."</p>

<p>A confused clamor arose from San Marco, above the
sound of the bells, spread over the Piazzetta, and died
away toward the Fortuna.</p>

<p>"May all light be on your brow, Stelio!" said La Foscarina,
holding out her burning hands to him passionately.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>THE FACE OF TRUTH</small></h2>


<p>When he entered the court by the south door,
Stelio Effrena, seeing the black and white
throng that swarmed up the Giants' Stairway,
in the ruddy light of the torches
fixed in the iron candelabra, felt a sudden sensation of
repugnance, and paused at the entrance. He noted the
contrast between this paltry crowd and the noble architecture
which, magnified by the unusual nocturnal illumination,
expressed, by their varied harmoniousness,
the strength and the beauty of a day that was past.</p>

<p>"Oh, how miserable!" he exclaimed, turning to the
friends that accompanied him. "In the Hall of the
Greater Council, from the throne of the Doges, how is
it possible to find metaphors that will move a thousand
starched shirt-bosoms? Let us go back; let us inhale
the odor of the real crowd, the true crowd. The Queen
has not yet left the royal palace. We have time
enough."</p>

<p>"Until the moment that I see you on the platform, I
shall not feel sure that you will really speak," said Francesco
de Lizo, laughing.</p>

<p>"I believe that Stelio would prefer the balcony to the
platform," said Piero Martello, wishing to flatter the
master's taste for sedition, and his factious spirit, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
he himself affected, in imitation. "He would like to harangue,
between the two red columns, the mutinous people
who threatened to set fire to the new <cite>Procuratie</cite> and
the old <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Libreria</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said Stelio, "if the harangue had
power to prevent or to precipitate an irreparable act. I
hold that we use the written word to create a pure form
of beauty, which, even in an uncut book, is enclosed and
shut in, as in a tabernacle that may be entered only by
election, with the same premeditated will used in the
breaking of a seal. But the spoken word, it seems to
me, when it is addressed directly to a multitude, should
have only action for its aim. On this condition alone
can a proud spirit, without lessening itself in dignity,
communicate with the masses by means of voice and
gesture. Otherwise, his effort becomes merely histrionic.
And so I repent bitterly of having accepted this function
of an ornamental orator, who must not speak unless he
speaks agreeably. Consider, I ask you, how humiliating
for me is the honor that they think to do me, and consider
also the uselessness of my speech. All these
people, strangers here, have left their mediocre occupations,
or their favorite amusements, to come and listen
to me with the same vain and stupid curiosity that would
lead them to listen to some new virtuoso. For the
women that will listen to me, the art with which I have
tied my cravat will be much more appreciated than the
art with which I shall round my periods. And, after
all, the only effect of my speech will be a clapping of
hands, deadened by gloves, or a brief, discreet murmur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to which I shall reply with a gracious inclination of the
head. Does it seem to you that I am about to attain
the summit of my ambition?"</p>

<p>"You are wrong," said Francesco de Lizo. "You
should congratulate yourself for this happy occasion,
which will allow you, for several hours, to impress the
rhythm of art on the life of a forgetful city, and to make
us dream of the splendors that might embellish our existence
by a renewed union of Art with Life. If the
man that built the Teatro di Festa were there, he would
praise you for that harmony which he predicted. But
the most wonderful thing about this affair is the fact
that, notwithstanding your absence, and your ignorance
of the project, the festival seems to have been prepared
under the direct inspiration of your genius. This is the
best proof that it is possible to restore and diffuse taste,
even in the midst of the barbaric present. Your influence
to-day is more powerful than you think. The lady
who has desired to honor you&mdash;she that you call the
Dogeressa&mdash;at every new idea that came to her, asked
herself: 'Would it please Effrena?' If you only knew
how many young and eager spirits put to themselves to-day
the same question, when they consider the aspects
of their inner life!"</p>

<p>"And for whom should you speak, if not for them?"
said Daniele Glauro, the fervent and sterile ascetic of
Beauty, with that melodious voice which seemed to reflect
the frank and inextinguishable ardor of the soul
beloved by the master as one of the most faithful. "If,
when you stand upon the platform, you will look about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
you, you will easily recognize the expression in their
eyes. There are many of them, and some have come a
long distance; they await your words with an eagerness
that you perhaps do not understand. They are those
who have imbibed the spirit of your poetry, who have
breathed the fiery ether of your dream, and felt the grip
of your chimera; those to whom you have announced
the transfiguration of the world by the miracle of a new
art. The number that you have attracted as an apostle
of hope and of joy is very great. They have heard that
you are to speak in Venice, in the Ducal Palace&mdash;one
of the most splendid and glorious places on earth. They
will be able to see you and listen to you for the first
time, surrounded by the magnificence that seems to them
an appropriate frame to your personality. The old Palace
of the Doges, which has so long been wrapped in
nocturnal darkness, is suddenly illuminated and aroused
this night for you, and, to their minds, it is you alone
that have had the power to rekindle these long-extinguished
torches. Do you understand now the eagerness
of their expectation? Does it not seem to you that to
them only you ought to speak? The condition you impose
on the man that harangues a multitude may be fulfilled.
You can awaken an emotion in their breasts that
shall turn them forever toward the Ideal. For how
many of them, Stelio, you might make this Venetian
night an experience never to be forgotten!"</p>

<p>Stelio laid his hand on the prematurely bent shoulders
of the mystic doctor, and, smiling, repeated Petrarch's
words: "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non ego loquar omnibus, sed tibi, sed mihi, et his</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw within himself the radiant eyes of his unknown
disciples, and heard within his soul, in clear tones,
the sound of his own exordium.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," he replied gayly, addressing Piero
Martello, "it would be amusing to conjure up a tempest
on this sea."</p>

<p>They were standing under the arch, near a column,
in contact with the noisy, unanimous crowd, which gathered
in the Piazzetta, stretched out toward the Zecca,
was swallowed up near the <em>Procuratie</em>, barred the Torre
dell'Orologio, occupied every space like a wave without
form, and communicated its living warmth to the marble
columns and the walls, against which it surged in its
violent movement. From time to time, a louder cry arose
from the distance, at the farther end of the Piazza,
swelling higher and stronger until it burst out near them
like a clap of thunder, then diminishing until it died
away in a murmur.</p>

<p>"I should like to-night to find myself for the first
time with a woman I loved, on a floating couch, over
there, beyond the gardens, toward the Lido," said the
romantic poet, Paris Eglano, a blond, beardless youth,
whose handsome mouth, with its full red lips, contrasted
with the almost angelic delicacy of his other features.
"Within an hour, Venice will present to some Nero-like
lover, hidden in a gondola, the spectacle of a city set on
fire by its own delirium."</p>

<p>Stelio smiled, noting to what extent his intimates had
become imbued with his own spiritual essence, and how
deep the seal of his own style had stamped itself on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
minds. Suddenly the image of La Foscarina flashed
across his mental vision: La Foscarina, poisoned by too
much art, remembering too many amatory experiences,
with the stamp of maturity and of corruption on her
eloquent mouth, the aridity of the vein fever that burned
in those hands that pressed out the juices of deceitful
fruits, and the marks of a hundred masks on that face
which had simulated the fury of all mortal passions.
Thus she appeared to his ardent thought of her, and his
heart throbbed faster as he pictured her emerging soon
from the multitude, as from some element that enslaved
her, and thought that from her glance he should draw
the necessary inspiration.</p>

<p>"Come, let us go," said he resolutely to his friends.
"It is the hour."</p>

<p>The cannon announced that the Queen had left the
royal palace. A prolonged quiver ran through the living
human mass, like that which precedes a storm at sea.
From the bank of San Giorgio Maggiore, a rocket rushed
up with a long hiss, rising in the air like a fiery stem
and bursting into a mass of pink splendor at the top;
then it curved, grew fainter, and dissolved in trembling
sparks, extinguished finally with a slight crackling in
the water. And the joyous clamor that greeted the
beautiful Queen, repeating her name&mdash;the name of the
starry, white flower and of the pearl&mdash;evoked in Stelio's
imagination the pomp of the ancient Promissione, the
triumphal procession of the Arts escorting the new
Dogaressa to the palace; the wave of joy on which Morosina
Grimani mounted to her throne, shimmering with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
gold, while all the Arts bowed before her, laden with
gifts as if they bore horns of plenty.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Francesco de Lizo, "if the Queen
loves your books, she will wear all her pearls this evening.
You will have before you a veritable labyrinth of
jewels&mdash;all the hereditary gems of the Venetian patricians."</p>

<p>"Look toward the foot of the stairway, Stelio," said
Daniele Glauro. "A group of devotees is waiting for
you to pass that way."</p>

<p>Stelio stopped at the well indicated by La Foscarina.
He leaned over the bronze edge, his knees touching the
little carved caryatides, and saw in the dark water the
reflection of the stars. For the moment his soul isolated
itself, shut out the surrounding sounds, and withdrew
into the shadowy disc, from which rose a slight dampness
betokening the presence of water. His excited desire
felt a need to attain even greater intoxication than
this night promised him, and he felt that in the farthest
depths of his being lay a secret soul, which, like this
dark, watery mirror, remained immovable, strange, and
intangible.</p>

<p>"What do you see there?" inquired Piero Martello,
also leaning over the rim, worn in places by the ropes
of centuries.</p>

<p>"The face of Truth!" the master answered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the apartments contiguous to the Hall of the
Greater Council, once occupied by the Doge, but now
by the pagan statues that were seized as booty in ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
wars, Stelio awaited the summons from the master
of the ceremonies to mount to the platform. He was
quite calm, and smiled on the friends that spoke to him,
but their words reached his ear between pauses, like interrupted
sounds borne from afar by the wind. From
time to time, with an abrupt, involuntary movement, he
drew near to one of the statues, and ran his hand nervously
over it, as if seeking some weak spot, that he
might break it; or he bent curiously over some rare
medal, as if to read on it some indecipherable sign. But
his eyes saw nothing of all this; they were turned within,
where the multiplied power of his will evoked the
silent forms that his voice would presently transform
into the perfection of verbal music. His whole being
contracted itself in an effort to raise to the highest degree
of intensity the representation of the extraordinary
feelings that possessed him. Since he could speak only
of himself, and of his own universe, at least he would
unite in one ideal figure the sovereign qualities of his
art, and show to his disciples by his genius for imagery
what an invincible force hastened him through this life.
Once more he intended to show them that, in order to
obtain the victory over men and circumstances, there is
no other way than to persevere in exalting oneself and
to magnify one's own dream of beauty or of power.</p>

<p>He bent over a medallion by Pisanello, feeling at his
temples the ardent, rapid pulsation of his thought.</p>

<p>"See, Stelio," said Daniele Glauro to him, with that
pious reverence which veiled his voice whenever he spoke
of his religion, "see how the mysterious affinities of Art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
work upon you, and how an infallible instinct leads you,
amid so many forms, and at the very moment when
your thought is about to reveal itself, toward the example
of the most perfect expression, the highest model
of style. At the very instant of coining your own idea,
you are led to study one of Pisanello's medallions; you
are attracted by the impression of one of the greatest
stylists that ever have lived in the world, the most
frankly Hellenic soul of the whole Renaissance. And
suddenly your forehead is illumined by a ray of light."</p>

<p>The pure bronze bore the effigy of a young man with
beautiful, waving hair, an imperial profile and Apollo-like
neck, and the head was so perfect a type of elegance
and vigor that the imagination could not picture him in
life except as free from all decadence and eternally unchangeable,
as the artist had presented him in this
circle of bronze.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dux equitum præstans Malatesta Novellus
Cesenæ dominus. Opus Pisani pictoris.</i>&mdash;And beside it was
another medallion by the same artist, bearing the effigy
of a virgin, with narrow chest, a swan-like throat, and
hair drawn back in the shape of a heavy bag; the forehead,
high and receding, seemed already to promise the
aureole of the blessed, and she was like a vase of purity
sealed forever, hard, precise, and limpid as a diamond,
an adamantine pyx where the spirit, consecrated like the
Host, rested as a sacrifice.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cicilia Virgo, filia Johannis

<p>"Here comes La Foscarina, with Donatella Arvale,"
announced Francesco de Lizo, who had been watching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the crowd that climbed the Censors' Stairway and
pressed into the vast hall.</p>

<p>Again Stelio Effrena felt a wave of agitation sweep
over him. The murmur of the throng seemed to come
from afar and mingle in his ears with the throbbing of
his arteries, and in this murmur he fancied he heard
once more the last words of Perdita.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>THE NUPTIALS OF AUTUMN AND VENICE</small></h2>


<p>The murmur swelled louder, diminished, then
ceased, as Stelio, with firm, light movement,
ascended the marble steps of the platform. As
he turned toward the audience, his dazzled eyes
rested upon the formidable monster with a thousand
human faces, amid the gold and somber purple of the
immense hall.</p>

<p>A sudden thrill of pride gave him complete self-control.
He bowed to the Queen and to Donna Andriano
Duodo, who smiled upon him with the same twin smiles
he had seen from the gliding gondola on the Grand
Canal. He threw a keen glance toward the scintillating
first rows, seeking La Foscarina, then looked toward
the farther end of the hall, where only a dark zone,
dotted with white spots, could be distinguished. The
silent, attentive multitude seemed to him like an enormous,
many-eyed chimera, its breast covered with glittering
scales, extending its black bulk under the arches of
the rich, heavy ceiling that hung over it like a suspended
treasure.</p>

<p>Dazzling was that chimeric breast, where sparkled
necklaces that must once have flashed their fires under
the same ceiling on the night of a coronation banquet.
The tiara and the necklaces of the Queen&mdash;the rows of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
pearls, like grains of light, somehow suggesting the miraculous
image of a smile just about to appear&mdash;the dark
emeralds of Andriano Duodo, taken long ago from the
handle of a scimitar; the rubies of Giustiniana Memo,
set in the semblance of carnations by the inimitable
craftsmanship of Vettor Camelio; the sapphires of Lucrezia
Priuli, taken from the shoes in which the Most
Serene Zilia had walked to her throne on the day of
her triumph; the beryls of Orsetta Contarini, delicately
set in dull gold by the art of Silvestro Grifo; the turquoises
of Zenobia Corner, bathed in a strange pallor by
the mysterious malady that, in a single night, changed
them as they lay on the warm breast of the Princess de
Lusignan, among the delights of Asolo&mdash;all the rich
jewels that had illumined the nights of the Anadyomenean
city glowed with renewed fire on the breast of
the chimera, from which rose a moist odor of feminine
breaths and many perfumes. The rest of that strangely
marked and shapeless body extended to the rear of the
hall, in a sort of long tail, passing between the two gigantic
spheres, which recalled to the memory of the
"Image-maker" the two bronze spheres that the monster
with the bandaged eyes presses with his paws in
Giambellino's allegory. And this vast animal life, devoid
of all thought for the time before him who alone
at that moment must think, endowed with the inert fascination
of enigmatic idols, covered with its own silence
as with a shield capable of receiving and resisting any
shock, awaited the first thrill of his dominating word.</p>

<p>Stelio Effrena measured this silence, upon which his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
first syllable must fall. While his voice was rising to his
lips, an effort of will summoning it and fortifying it
against instinctive hesitation, he perceived La Foscarina
standing near the railing that encircled the celestial
sphere. The pale face of the tragic actress rose from
her bare neck, and the purity of her white shoulders was
just above the orbit of the zodiacal figures. Stelio admired
the art of this apparition. With his own eyes fixed
upon those distant, adoring ones, he began to speak
slowly, as if the rhythm of the oars still lingered in his
ears.</p>

<p>"One afternoon, not long ago, while I was returning
from the gardens along the warm bank of the Schiavoni,
where the souls of poets sometimes believe they see I
know not what magic golden bridge spanning a sea of
light and silence toward a dream of infinite beauty, I
thought&mdash;or rather, I witnessed with my thoughts, as
at some intimate spectacle&mdash;of the nuptial alliance, under
those skies, of Autumn and Venice.</p>

<p>"Everywhere was disseminated a spirit of life, arising
from passionate expectation and restrained ardor, which
made me marvel at its vehemence, but which seemed not
altogether new to me; I had already seen it in some
shadowy zones, under the almost death-like immobility
of Summer; and sometimes I had felt it vibrating, like
a mysterious pulse, in the strange feverish odor of the
water. Thus, I thought, it is true, then, that this pure
city of Art aspires to a supreme state of beauty which
for her returns annually, as the flowers return to the
forest. She tends to reveal herself in full harmony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
as if always she bore within her bosom, powerful and
conscious, the same desire of perfection from which
she sprang and was formed throughout the ages, like
some divine creature. Under the motionless fire of
Summer, she seemed to palpitate no more, to breathe
no more, but to lie dead in her green waters. My feeling
did not deceive me, however, when I fancied I saw
her secretly inspired by a spirit of life sufficient to
renew the most sublime of the ancient miracles.</p>

<p>"That is what I thought, and what I saw. But how
can I convey to you that listen to me any idea of that
vision of joy and beauty? No sunrise, no sunset, could
equal the glory of that hour of light on the water and
the marble. The unexpected apparition of the beloved
woman in a forest in springtime could not be as intoxicating
as this sudden revelation by daylight of the
heroic and voluptuous city, which carries in its marble
embrace the richest dream of a Latin soul."</p>

<p>The voice of the orator, clear, penetrating, almost icy
at the beginning, was suddenly warmed by the invisible
sparks kindled within him by the effort of improvisation,
yet governed by the extreme nicety of his ear. While
his words flowed without hesitation, and the rhythmic
line of his periods set forth their beauty with the clearness
of a figure drawn at one stroke by a bold hand, his
auditors were conscious of the excessive tension of his
mind, and it captivated them as one of those terrifying
feats at the circus, where all the herculean energies of
the athlete show the test by his quivering tendons and
swelling arteries. They felt the reality, the living warmth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of the thought thus expressed, and their pleasure was
the greater because unexpected, for most of his auditors
had anticipated from this indefatigable searcher after
perfection the studied reading of a laboriously composed
discourse. His devotees observed with emotion this audacious
test, as if they saw before them, unveiled, the
secret labor that had brought forth the forms that had
given them so much joy. And this first wave of emotion,
spreading by contagion, indefinitely multiplied and
becoming unanimous, returned to him who caused it,
and seemed almost to overcome him.</p>

<p>This was the expected danger. Under the pressure
of a wave so strong, the speaker faltered. For a few
seconds a thick cloud darkened his brain; the light of
his mind was extinguished, as a torch before an irresistible
wind; his eyes grew dim, as if he were about
to faint. But he felt how mortifying would be the shame
of defeat if he yielded to this seizure; and in that darkness,
by a sort of effort of brute force, or like the striking
of steel on flint, his will rose in triumph over the instinctive
weakness. With glance and gesture, he directed
the eyes of the assemblage to the great masterpiece in
the ceiling of that hall, spreading there in a kind of
sun-like radiance.</p>

<p>"I am certain," he exclaimed, "that Venice appeared
thus to Paolo Veronese, when he sought within himself
for an image of the Queen triumphant."</p>

<p>He explained the reason why the great master, after
throwing upon his canvas a profusion of gold, jewels,
silks, purple, ermine, and all imaginable richness, at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
could represent the glorious face only in the nimbus of
a shadow.</p>

<p>"We ought to exalt Veronese for that shadowy veil
alone! Representing by a human face the Queen of
Cities, he yet knew how to express its essential spirit,
whose symbol was an inextinguishable flame seen
through a watery veil. And one I know well, who, having
plunged his soul in this sublime element, has withdrawn
it enriched with a new power, and consequently
has lived a fuller and more ardent spiritual life."</p>

<p>This one he knew well&mdash;was it not himself? In the
assertion of his own personality he found again all his
courage, and felt that henceforth he was master of his
thoughts and words, freed from danger, capable of drawing
within the charmed circle of his dream the enormous,
many-eyed chimera, with the glittering breast&mdash;the
ephemeral and versatile monster from whose side
emerged its offspring, the Tragic Muse, her head rising
above the constellations.</p>

<p>Obedient to his movement, the innumerable faces
turned toward the Apotheosis, their awakened eyes contemplating
with wonder this marvel, as if they beheld
it for the first time, or under a new aspect. The naked
back of the woman with the golden helmet shone under
the cloud with an effect of muscular life so perfect
that it looked as attractive as palpable flesh. And, from
this nudity, more realistic than all the rest, victorious
over Time, which had darkened around it heroic images
of sieges and battles, seemed to emanate a powerful enchantment,
the sweetness of which was augmented by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the breath of the autumn night coming through the open
windows; while, from above, the princesses of a former
day, leaning over the balustrades between two columns,
inclined their illumined faces and opulent breasts toward
their worldly sisters below.</p>

<p>Under the new spell of enchantment, the poet threw
off his winged words, harmonious as lyric strophes. He
described the Queen City palpitating with ardor within
her thousand green girdles, extending her marble arms
toward the wild Autumn, whose humid breath reached
her, balmy with the delicious death of the fields and
islands, making her sigh like a bride awaiting her hour
of joy. By the magic of his words, Venice seemed to
be possessed of marvelous hands, with which she wove
for herself the inimitable tissue of allegory that covered
her.</p>

<p>"And since, in all the world, poetry alone is truth, he
that knows how to contemplate it, and to draw it into
his own soul by the virtue of his thought, will be very
near to mastering the secret of victory over life."</p>

<p>In pronouncing these last words, Stelio sought the
eyes of Daniele Glauro, and saw that they sparkled with
happiness beneath that large, meditative brow, which
seemed swollen by the weight of an unborn world. The
mystic doctor was there, near the platform, with several
of those unknown disciples that he had described to
the master as eager and anxious, full of faith and expectation,
impatient to break the chain of their daily servitude,
and to know the free intoxication of joy and
sadness. Stelio noted that they were grouped, like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
nucleus of compressed force, against the great red bookcases,
wherein lay buried innumerable volumes of useless
and forgotten lore. He marked their eager and attentive
faces, their long hair, their lips, half parted with
child-like absorption, or closed tightly in a kind of violent
sensitiveness, their bright eyes, to which the breath
of his words carried lights and shadows, as a changeful
breeze stirs a parterre of delicate flowers. He felt that
in his own hand he held all their souls blended into one
spirit, which he could at will agitate, crush, tear, or
burn, as if it were a filmy scarf.</p>

<p>While his mind expanded and relaxed, in its continued
effort, he still retained a strange power of exterior investigation,
a faculty of material observation which became
the clearer and more penetrating with the warmth
and quickening of his eloquence.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw with his mental vision the picture
he wished to present, and his verbal expression of it
was after the manner of the master painters that had
reigned in that place, with the luxuriance of Veronese,
and the fire of Tintoretto.</p>

<p>"All the vitalities and all the transfigurations of the
ancient stones, where Time has accumulated so many
mysteries, and where glory has set her emblems; all the
alternations of marvelously easy creations and destructions
were reflected in the water; the effulgence of a jubilant
light glittered between the crosses of cupolas
inflated by prayer, and the slender saline crystals hanging
under the arch of the bridges. Like a sentinel on a
rampart uttering his shrill cry to him that listens for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the signal, so the golden angel from the summit of the
highest tower at last flashed out the announcement.</p>

<p>"And He appeared! The Bridegroom appeared, seated
in his fiery chariot, which he turned toward the Queen
of Cities, and in his youthful, superhuman countenance
was a strange fascination springing from an animal-like
cruelty and delicacy contrasting with the deep eyes, full
of all knowledge. His blood rioted through his veins,
from the tips of his fingers to his nimble feet; mysterious,
occult things veiled his being, concealing joy
as the grape in bloom conceals the vine; and all the
tawny gold and purple that surrounded him were like
the vestment of his senses.</p>

<p>"With what passion, throbbing under her thousand
emerald girdles, and the richness of her jewels, the
Queen of Cities gave herself to the magnificent god!"</p>

<p>Swept up in this rushing flight of words, the soul
of the multitude seemed to reach the sentiment of
Beauty, as if it were a summit never before attained. The
pulse of the people and the voice of the poet seemed to
give back to those ancient walls their former life, and
to reawaken in that cold museum its original spirit: a
flood of powerful ideas, concrete, and organized in the
most durable substance to attest the nobility of a great
race.</p>

<p>The splendor of divine youth descended upon the
women, as it might have descended in a sumptuous alcove,
for each felt within herself the breathlessness of
expectation and the joy of yielding, like that of the
Queen of Cities. They smiled with vague languor as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
wearied by the strain upon their emotions; their cool,
polished shoulders rose from their corollas of jewels.</p>

<p>Stelio looked down upon the sparkling breast of the
great, many-eyed chimera, on which rose and fell many
fluttering feather fans, like tiny wings; and over his
spirit passed an intoxicating glow that disquieted him.
The vibration of his nerves, acting upon those of his
auditors and thus reacting upon himself, unsettled him
so much as almost to unbalance him. For an instant
he felt that he was oscillating above the crowd, like a
concave and sonorous body, the resonances of which
were engendered by an indistinct yet infallible will.</p>

<p>He was surprised at the unknown power that dwelt
within him, abolishing his own personal limits and conferring
the fulness of a chorus on his single voice.</p>

<p>This, then, was the mysterious truce which the revelation
of Beauty could grant to the daily existence of
wearied man; this was the mysterious will that could
possess the poet at the moment when he replied to the
souls of his followers who questioned him as to the value
of life and tried to raise themselves, if only once, to
the height of the eternal Ideal. He was only the messenger
through whom Beauty offered to those men, assembled
in this place consecrated by centuries of human
glory, the divine gift of oblivion. He was only the translator
into rhythmic speech of the visible language whereby,
in this same place, the noble craftsmen of a former
day had expressed the prayers and aspirations of the
race. And for one hour, at least, those men would contemplate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the world with different eyes; they would
think and dream with different souls.</p>

<p>In fancy, he passed beyond the walls that enclosed
the palpitating throng in a kind of heroic cycle, a circle
of red triremes, fortified towers, and triumphal theories.
The place now seemed too narrow for the exaltation
of his new feeling; and once more he was drawn toward
the real people, the immense, unanimous crowd he had
seen outside the palace, who had sent upward in the
starry night a clamor that, like blood or wine, intoxicated
them as they uttered it.</p>

<p>And not alone to this multitude did his thoughts turn;
his fancy beheld an infinity of multitudes, massed together
in theaters, dominated by an idea of truth and of
beauty, pale and intent before the great arch of the
stage, which should open before them some marvelous
transfiguration of life, or frenzied by the sudden splendor
radiating from an immortal phrase. And the dream
of a higher Art, as it surged up again in his thought
showed him mankind once more reverencing poets, as
those who alone can interrupt at intervals its daily anguish,
quench its thirst, and dispense oblivion. He even
judged too slight the test he was now undergoing; he
felt himself capable of creating gigantic fictions. The
still formless work that he nourished in his soul shook
him with a thrill of life as he looked again at the tragedienne,
standing above the sphere of constellations&mdash;the
Muse with the transcendent voice, who seemed to
carry the frenzy of far-off throngs, now silenced, in the
classic folds of her robes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost overcome by the incredible intensity of emotion
that had possessed him during the brief pause, he
began to speak again in a lower tone. He spoke of the
growth of art between the youth of Giorgione and the
old age of Tintoretto, and described it as golden, purple,
rich and expressive as the pomp of the earth irradiated
by the glow of sunset.</p>

<p>"When I consider the impetuous creators of such marvelous
beauty, my mind recalls an image from a fragment
of Pindar's: 'When the centaurs became acquainted
with the virtues of wine, sweet as honey and
a conqueror of men, they banished milk from their
tables and hastened to quaff their wine from silver horns.'
No one in the world better knew than they how to taste
the wine of life. They drew from it a kind of lucid intoxication
that multiplied their powers and communicated
to their eloquence a fertilizing energy. And in
their greatest creations, the violent throbbing of their
pulses seems to have persisted throughout the ages, like
the veritable rhythm of Venetian art.</p>

<p>"Ah, how pure and poetic is the slumber of the Virgin
Ursula on her immaculate bed! The most religious silence
reigns in that chamber, where the pious lips of the
sleeper seem to form themselves into the act of uttering
prayer. Through the doors and the windows steals
the timid light of dawn, illumining the syllables inscribed
on her pillow: INFANTIA is the simple word
that spreads around that virginal head, like the fresh
aurora of the morning: INFANTIA. She sleeps, the
maiden already betrothed to the pagan prince and destined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to martyrdom. So chaste, so ingenuous, so fervent,
is she not the image of Art such as the precursors
saw it, with the sincerity of their child-like eyes? INFANTIA!
The word evokes around that couch all those
forgotten ones: Lorenzo Veneziano, Simone da Cusighe,
Catarino, Jacobello, Maestro Paolo, Giambono, Semitecolo,
Antonio, Andrea, Quirizio da Murano, and all the
laborious family by whom color&mdash;which later was the
rival of fire&mdash;was prepared in the burning island of furnaces.
But would not they themselves have uttered a
cry of admiration if they had seen the drops of blood
that sprang from the maiden's heart when it was pierced
by the arrow of the beautiful pagan archer? A current
so red from a virgin nourished on white milk! This victory
was a sort of festival: to it the archers brought their
finest bows, their richest garments, their most elegant
air. The golden-haired barbarian, aiming his arrows at
the martyr, with a movement so proud and graceful,
does he not resemble an adolescent and wingless Eros?
That gracious slayer of innocence (or perhaps his
brother), after laying aside his bow, will abandon himself
to the enchantment of music to dream a dream of
infinite pleasure.</p>

<p>"It was indeed Giorgione that poured into him a new
soul, and kindled it with an implacable longing. The
music that charms him is not the melody that last night
the lutes diffused among the curving arches, over radiant
thrones, or diminishing in the silence of distances in the
visions of the third Bellini. Under the touch of religious
hands, it still rises from the harpsichord; but the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
it awakens is full of a joy and a sadness wherein sin hides
its head.</p>

<p>"He that has looked at the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Concerto</i> with the eyes of
wisdom has comprehended an extraordinary and irrevocable
moment of the Venetian soul. By means of a
harmony of color&mdash;whose power of expression is as
boundless as the mystery of sounds&mdash;the artist reveals
the first agitation of an eager spirit to whom life has
suddenly appeared under the aspect of a rich inheritance.</p>

<p>"The monk, seated at his harpsichord, and his older
companion, do not resemble those monks that Vettor
Carpaccio represented as flying before the wild beast
tamed by Jerome, in San Giorgio degli Schiavoni. Their
essence is nobler and stronger; they breathe an atmosphere
higher and richer, propitious to the birth of a
great joy, a great sadness, or a superb dream. What
notes do those beautiful, sensitive hands draw from the
keys on which they linger? Magic notes, no doubt, since
they have power to work in the musician a transfiguration
so great. He is half-way through his mortal existence,
already far from his youth and near his decline,
yet only now life reveals itself to him, rich with all good
things, like a forest full of ripe, red fruit, the velvety
freshness of which his always busy hands never before
have known. As his senses still slumber, he has not
yet fallen under the domination of a single seductive
image, but he suffers a sort of confused anguish wherein
regret overcomes desire, while in the web of harmonies
that he seeks, the vision of his past&mdash;but only as it might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
have been and was not&mdash;weaves itself like the tissue of a
chimera.</p>

<p>"His companion divines this inner agitation, for he is
already at the threshold of old age; calm, sweet, and
serious, he touches the shoulder of the passionate player
with a pacifying movement. But there, emerging from
the warm shadows like the embodiment of youthful ardor
itself, is the young man with hat beplumed and flowing
locks, the glowing flower of adolescence which Giorgione
created under the influence of a reflection from
that Hellenic myth whence arose the ideal form of Hermaphrodite.
He is there, present, yet a stranger, separated
from the others, like a being that cares only for
his own welfare. The music exalts his inexpressible
dream, and seems to multiply indefinitely his capacity
to enjoy. He knows himself master of that life which
escapes the other two, and the harmonies sought by the
musician seem to him only the prelude to his own feast.
His glance is sidewise and intent, turned toward a certain
point, as if he would attract to himself something
that charms him; his closed lips are ready with a kiss
as yet ungiven; his brow is so spacious that the thickest
garland would not encumber it; but if I think of his
hands, I fancy them crushing the laurel leaves to perfume
his fingers."</p>

<p>The hands of the Inspirer illustrated the gesture of
the covetous youth, as if they were really pressing out
the essence of the aromatic leaf; and his voice lent to the
image an illusion so strong that the young men felt that
here at last was one who could express their cherished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and secret thoughts and dreams, and give voice to their
unspeakable, continuous, and ceaseless longings. They
occupied the free space at the back of the seated audience,
making a living border for that compact mass; and, as
the edges of a flag that waves in the breeze have a
stronger flutter, these youthful hearts beat faster than
those of older men at the warm breath of the poet's
words.</p>

<p>Stelio recognized them, distinguishing them by their
singularity of attitude, the intensity of emotion revealed
by their compressed lips and the glow of ardor in their
cheeks. On the face of one, turned toward the open
balcony, he read the enchantment of the autumn night,
and the delicious breeze coming from the lagoon. The
glance of another indicated, by a ray of love, some
woman, seated near by, looking as if she were lost in
tender recollections, her face white, her red lips slightly
parted, like the entrance to a hive moist with honey.</p>

<p>His eyes continually returned to the promised woman,
who looked as she stood there like the living support of
a starry sphere. He was grateful to her for her choice
of this manner of appearing to him when, for the first
time, he gave himself to the people. He no longer regarded
her as merely the passing fancy of a single night,
a woman ripened by long experience, but the marvelous
instrument of a new art, the interpreter of the greatest
poetry, she that should incarnate in her changeful personality
his future fictions of beauty, she whose unforgettable
voice should carry to mankind the long-expected
word. He now felt attached to her, not by a promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of love, but by a promise of glory; and the formless work
that he still cherished in his breast again leaped within
him.</p>

<p>"You that listen to me," he continued, "do you not
see some analogy between these three symbols of Giorgione's
and the three generations, all living at the same
time, that illumined the dawn of a new century? Venice,
the City Triumphant, reveals herself to their eyes like a
great, a superabundant banquet, where all the riches accumulated
throughout centuries of war and commerce
are to be set out without stint. What richer fountain
of pleasure could there be to initiate life in insatiable
desire? It is a time of agitation, almost of distraction,
which, because of its fulness, is worth an hour of heroic
violence. Alluring voices and laughter seem to float
from the hills of Asolo where, surrounded by all delights,
reigns the daughter of San Marco, Domina Aceli,
who found in a myrtle grove of Cyprus the cincture of
Aphrodite. Now approaches the youth with the white
plumes; he comes to the banquet, followed by his uncurbed
escort, and all desires kindle and burn like torches
quickened by the wind. And this was the beginning
of that divine Autumn of Art toward which men will
always turn with deep emotion as long as the human
soul strives to transcend the narrowness of its common
existence in order to live a life more fervent or to die
a nobler death.</p>

<p>"I see Giorgione imminent on the marvelous sphere,
but I do not recognize his mortal person; I seek him
in the mystery of the fiery cloud that envelops him. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
appears to us more myth-like than human. The destiny
of no poet on earth is comparable to his. All concerning
his life is unknown; some even go so far as to deny
his existence. His name is inscribed on no work, and
many refuse to attribute any work to him with absolute
certainty. But the whole of Venetian art was illumined
by his revelation; it was from him that the great
Titian received the secret of infusing glowing blood into
the veins of the beings he created. In fact, that which
Giorgione represents in Art is the Epiphany of the
Flame. He deserves to be called 'the Flame-Bearer,' like
Prometheus.</p>

<p>"When I consider the rapidity with which this sacred
gift has passed from one artist to another, glowing with
increasing splendor from color to color, I think of one
of those <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lampadeforie</i>, or festivals, in which the Greeks
tried to perpetuate the memory of the Titan son of
Japetus. On the day of the festival, a group of young
Athenian horsemen would set off at a gallop, riding from
Ceramicus to Colonos, their chief waving a torch that
had been lighted at the altar of a temple. If the torch
was extinguished by the swiftness of the course, the
bearer handed it to a companion, who re-lighted it as
he rode; and this one gave it to a third; the third to a
fourth, and so on, always galloping, until the last bearer
laid it, still alight, on the altar of the Titan. This
image, with all it suggests of fiery vehemence, represents
to my fancy the feast of the master-colorists of
Venice. Each of them, even to the least illustrious, held
in his hand the sacred gift, if only for an instant. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of them, like that first Bonifacio, whom we should glorify,
gathered with incombustible fingers the inmost
flower of the flame."</p>

<p>His fingers made a movement in the air as if to pluck
the ideal flower. His eyes turned again toward the celestial
sphere, as if he wished to offer the fiery gift to
her who guarded the divine zodiacal beasts. "To you,
Perdita!" But the woman was smiling at some one at
a distance.</p>

<p>Following the thread of her smile, Stelio's eyes were
led to an unknown woman, who suddenly seemed to
stand out illumined against a shadowy background.</p>

<p>Was not that the creature of music whose name had
resounded against the iron sides of the ship that evening,
in the silence and the shadow?</p>

<p>She seemed to Stelio to be almost an interior image,
suddenly engendered in that part of his soul where the
brief sensation he had felt while passing through the
shadow of the vessel had remained like an isolated and
indistinct point. For a second she was beautiful&mdash;as
beautiful as were his yet unexpressed thoughts.</p>

<p>"The city to which such creators have given a soul so
powerful," he continued, floating himself on the rising
wave, "is considered to-day, by the greater number, only
as a vast inert reliquary, or as a refuge of peace and
oblivion.</p>

<p id="id59">"In truth, I know of no other place in the world&mdash;unless
it be Rome&mdash;where a bold and ambitious spirit can
better foster the active virtue of his intellect, and all
the energies of his being toward the supreme heights,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
than on these quiet waters. I know of no marsh capable
of provoking in human pulses a fever more violent
that that which at times steals up to us from the shadows
of a silent canal. Nor do those men who, at noontide
in the midsummer heat, lie among the ripe grain,
feel in their veins a more fiery wave of blood than that
which suffuses our eyes when we lean too intently over
these waters, to see whether, perchance, we may descry
in their depths some old sword or ancient diadem.</p>

<p>"Do not all gracious spirits come hither, as to a place
of sweet refuge&mdash;those that hide some secret pain, those
that have accomplished some final renunciation, those
that have become weak through some morbid affection,
and those that seek silence only to hear the soft step of
advancing Death? Perhaps in their fading eyes Venice
appears like a clement city of death, embraced by the
waters of oblivion. But their presence is no more important
than the wandering weeds that float at the foot
of the steps of the marble palaces. They only increase
the odor of sickly things, that strange, feverish odor on
which at times, toward evening, after a laborious day,
we nourish the fulness of our own feelings.</p>

<p>"But the ambiguous city does not always indulge the
illusions of those that look to her as a giver of peace.
I know one who, in the midst of sweet repose on her
breast, started up as terror-struck as if when lying beside
his loved one, with her hand resting on his weary
eyelids, he had heard serpents hissing in her hair!</p>

<p>"Ah, if I only knew how to tell you of that prodigious
life which palpitates beneath her great necklaces and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
thousand green girdles! Not a day passes that she
does not absorb more and more of our souls: sometimes
she gives them back to us fresh and intact, restored
to their original newness, whereon to-morrow's events
will be imprinted with indelible clearness; again, she
gives them back to us infinitely subtle and voracious,
like a flame that destroys all that it touches, so that, at
evening, among the cinders and the ashes, we may light
upon some wonderful sublimate. Each day she urges
us to the act that is the very genesis of our species: the
unceasing effort to surpass ourselves. She shows us the
possibility of transforming pain into the most efficacious
stimulating energy; she teaches us that pleasure is the
most certain means of knowledge given to us by Nature,
and that the man who has suffered much is less wise
than he that has enjoyed much."</p>

<p>At these audacious words, a slight murmur of disapproval
passed over the auditorium; the Queen shook her
head ever so little, in token of denial; several ladies, in
a rapid exchange of glances, seemed to signify to one
another a sentiment of graceful horror. But these signs
were overbalanced by the acclamation of youthful approval
that rose from all sides toward him that taught
with a boldness so frank the art of rising to the superior
forms of life by the virtue of joy.</p>

<p>Stelio smiled as he recognized his own, and so numerous;
he smiled to recognize the efficacy of his teaching,
which already, in more than one spirit, had dissipated
the clouds of inert sadness, shown it the cowardice
of weak tears, and infused it with a lasting disdain for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
feeble complaint and soft compassion. He rejoiced at
having been able to proclaim once more the principle of
his doctrine, emanating naturally from the soul of the
art he glorified. And those that had retired to a hermit's
cell, there to adore a sad phantom that lived only
in the dim mirror of their own eyes; those that had
created themselves kings of palaces without windows,
where, from time immemorial, they had awaited a Visitation;
those that had sought to unearth among ruins
the image of Beauty, but who had found only a worn
sphinx, which had tormented them with its endless
enigmas; those that stood every evening at their thresholds
to greet the mysterious Stranger bearing gifts
under his mantle, and who, with pale cheeks, laid their
ears against the ground to catch the first sound of the
Stranger's approach; those whose souls were sterilized
by resigned mourning or devoured by desperate pride;
those that were hardened by useless obstinacy, or deprived
of sleep by hope continually disappointed&mdash;all
these spirits he wished now to summon that they might
recognize their ailment under the splendor of that ancient
yet ever-new soul.</p>

<p>"In truth," said he, in a tone full of exultation, "if
the whole population, abandoning their homes, should
emigrate, attracted to-day toward other shores as formerly
their heroic youth were tempted by the arch of the
Bosphorus, in the time of the Doge Pietro Ziani, and the
voice of prayer should no more strike against the sonorous
gold of the concave mosaics, nor the sound of the
oar perpetuate with its rhythmic stroke the meditation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of the silent stones, Venice would still remain a City of
Life. The ideal creatures protected by its silence live in
the whole past and for the whole future. In them we
shall always discover new concordances with the edifice
of the universe, unforeseen meetings with the idea
born only yesterday, clear announcements of that which
is with us only a presentiment as yet, open answers
to that which as yet we have not dared to ask.</p>

<p>"These ideal creatures are simple, but they are full
of innumerable meanings; they are ingenuous, yet are
clothed in strange attire. Should we contemplate them
for an indefinite time, they never would cease to pour
dissimilar truths into our minds. Should we visit them
every day, every day they would appear to us under a
new aspect, as do the sea, the rivers, the fields, the
woods, the rocks. At times the things they say to us
do not really reach our intellects, but reveal themselves
to us in a sort of confused happiness, which causes our
own substance to dilate and quiver to its inmost depths.
Some bright day they will point out to us the path to
the distant forest, wherein Beauty has awaited us from
time immemorial, buried in her mystic hair.</p>

<p>"Whence came to them their immeasurable power?</p>

<p>"From the pure unconsciousness of the artificers that
created them.</p>

<p>"Those profound men ignored the immensity of the
things they wished to express. Penetrating with a million
roots into the soil of life, not like single trees, but
like vast forests, they absorbed infinite elements, which
they transfused and condensed into ideal species, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
essences nevertheless remained unknown to them, as the
flavor of the apple is unknown to the branch that bears
it. They were the mysterious means chosen by Nature
in her effort to represent in an integral form those types
in which she has not yet succeeded. Because of this,
continuing the work of the Divine Mother, their minds,
as Leonardo says, have become transformed into 'a likeness
of the Divine Mind.' And because creative force
rushed to their fingers incessantly, like sap to the buds
of trees, they created with joy."</p>

<p>All the desire of the determined artist, panting and
struggling to obtain this Olympian gift, all his envy
of those gigantic creators of Beauty, all his insatiable
thirst for happiness and glory, were revealed in the tone
in which he pronounced these last words. Once more
the soul of the multitude was under the magic of the
poet's spell, strained and vibrating like a single cord
composed of a thousand strands, the resonance of which
could be incalculably prolonged. That resonance awakened
within the multitude the sense of a truth that had
lain dormant, but which the poet's words now revealed
for the first time.</p>

<p>In the sonority of the deep silence, the solitary voice
reached its climax.</p>

<p>"To create with joy! It is the attribute of Divinity!
It is impossible to imagine at the summit of the spirit
an act more triumphal. Even the words that signify
it possess something of the splendor of sunrise.</p>

<p>"And these artists created by a medium that is in
itself a joyous mystery: by color, which is the ornament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the world; by color, which seems the effort of matter
to become light.</p>

<p>"And the newly awakened musical sense they had
for color was such that their creations transcend the
narrow limits of figured symbols, and assume the high
revealing power of an infinite harmony.</p>

<p>"Never have the words of Vinci, on whom Truth
flashed one day with her thousand secrets, appeared so
true as when we stand before the great symphonic canvases
of the masters: 'Music cannot be called anything
but the sister of Painting.' They are not alone silent
poetry, but also silent music. The most subtle seekers
of rare symbols, and those most desirous to impress
the sign of an internal universe on the purity of a meditative
brow, seem to us almost sterile compared with these
great unconscious musicians.</p>

<p>"When we behold Bonifacio, in the parable of Dives,
intoning with a note of fire the most powerful harmony
of color in which the essence of a proud and voluptuous
nature ever has revealed itself, we do not ask questions
about the blond youth, listening to the music and seated
between the two magnificent courtesans, whose faces
glow like lamps of purest amber; but, passing beneath
the material symbol, we abandon ourselves to the power
of evocation of those chords, wherein our spirits
seem to-day to find a presentiment of I know not what
evening, heavy with beautiful destiny and autumnal gold,
in a harbor as quiet as a basin of perfumed oil where
a galley palpitating with oriflammes shall enter with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
strange silence, like a butterfly of twilight darting into
the chalice of some great flower.</p>

<p>"Shall we not, with our mortal eyes, really see it, some
glorious evening, approaching the Palace of the Doges?
Does it not appear to us from a prophetic horizon in the
Allegory of Autumn which Tintoretto offers us, like a
superior, concrete image of our dream of yesterday?</p>

<p>"Seated on the shore, like a deity, Venice receives the
ring from the young, vine-wreathed god who descends
into the water, while Beauty floats in the air with a
starry diadem to crown the marvelous alliance!</p>

<p>"Behold yon distant ship! It seems to bring a message
from the gods. Behold the symbolic Woman! Her
body is capable of bearing the germs of a world!"</p>

<p>A whirlwind of applause broke out, dominated by the
clamor of the young men, who hailed him who had
kindled before their anxious eyes a hope so glowing, who
had professed a faith so strong in the occult genius of
the race, in the lofty virtue of the ideals handed down
by their fathers, in the sovereign dignity of their spirit,
the indestructible power of beauty, in all the great things
held as naught by modern barbarity. The disciples extended
their arms toward the master with an effusion of
gratitude, an impulse of love, for he had illumined their
souls as with a torch. In each lived again Giorgione's
creation: the youth with the beautiful white plumes, who
advanced toward the rich mass of spoils; and each fancied
as multiplied to infinity his own power to enjoy all
things. Their cry expressed so plainly their perturbation
of spirit, that the master felt an inward tremor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the inrush of a wave of sadness as he thought of the
ashes of this sudden fire, and of the cruel wakening of
the morrow. Against what sharp obstacles must be
broken this terrible desire to live, this violent will of
each to shape the wings of Victory to his own destiny,
and to bend all the energies of his nature toward the
sublime end!</p>

<p>But that night favored youthful delirium. All the
dreams of domination, of pleasure and of glory, that
Venice has first cradled, then stifled, in her marble arms,
seemed to rise anew from the foundations of the palace,
to enter from the open balconies, palpitating like a people
revivified under the arch of that rich and heavy ceiling,
which was like a suspended treasure. The strength
which, on the ceiling and the walls, seemed to swell the
muscles of the gods, the kings, and the heroes, the beauty
which, in the nudity of the goddesses, the queens, and
the courtesans, ran like visible music&mdash;all that human
strength and beauty, transfigured by centuries of art,
harmonized itself in a single figure, which these intoxicated
ones fancied they beheld, real and breathing,
erected before them by the new poet.</p>

<p>They vented their intoxicated enthusiasm in that great
cry which they sent up to him who had offered to their
thirsty lips a cup of his own wine. Henceforth, all would
be able to see the inextinguishable flame through its
watery veil. Some one among them already imagined
himself crumpling laurel leaves to perfume his hands;
and another resolved to seek at the bottom of a silent
canal for the old sword and the ancient diadem.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>THE SPIRIT OF MELODY</small></h2>


<p>Alone with the statues in one of the rooms
of the neighboring museum, Stelio Effrena
rested for a moment, shrinking from any other
contact, feeling the need of gathering his
strength and quieting his nerves, to free himself from
the unusual vibration through which it seemed to him
all the essence of his spirit had been dissipated and
scattered over the composite soul of the throng. Of
his recent words, no trace remained in his memory,
and of recent images he perceived no vestige. The
only phrase that lingered in his mind was that "inmost
flower of the flame," which he had conjured up in
speaking of the glory of the first Bonifacio, and which
he had plucked with his own incombustible fingers to
offer to his promised love. He remembered how, at the
precise instant of this spontaneous offering, the woman
had turned away her head, and how, instead of a glance
from her dreamy eyes, he had encountered the indicating
smile. Then the intoxicating cloud that had been just on
the point of melting away, seemed to condense itself anew
in his brain, in the vague form of the creature of music;
and he fancied that she held in her hand the flower of
flame, as, in a dominating attitude, she emerged above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
his inward agitation as from the trembling waves of a
summer sea.</p>

<p>As if to celebrate that image, from the Hall of the
Greater Council came the first notes of the symphony
of Benedetto Marcello, the fugue-like movement of which
revealed at once its grand style. A sonorous idea, clear
and strong as a living person, developed itself in the
powerful measure; and in that melody Stelio recognized
the virtue of the same principle around which, as around
a thyrsus, he had twined the garlands of his poesy.</p>

<p>Then the name that had already resounded against the
sides of the vessel, in the silence and the shadow, that
name which, in the great wave of sound from the evening
bells, had been lost like a sibylline leaf, seemed to
his fancy to propose its syllables to the orchestra as a
new theme to be interpreted by the musicians' bows.
The violins, viols, and violoncellos sang it in turn; the
sudden blasts of the heroic trumpets exalted it; and at
last a whole quartette, in one great, thrilling chord, flung
it toward that heaven of joy where later would sparkle
the starry crown offered to Ariadne by the golden
Aphrodite.</p>

<p>In the pause that followed, Stelio experienced a singular
agitation, almost like a religious ecstasy, before
that annunciation. He realized what it was worth to
him, in that inestimable lyric moment, to find himself
alone amid this group of white and motionless statues.
A shred of the same mystery which, under the quarter
of the ship, had seemed to float lightly across his senses
like a misty veil, again waved before his eyes in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
deserted hall, which was so near to the human throng.
It was like the silence of the sea-shell, lying on the shore
beside the stormy ocean. He again felt a conviction,
such as he had already experienced in certain extraordinary
hours of his journey, of the presence of his fate,
which was about to give to his spirit a new impulse,
perhaps to quicken within him a marvelous act of will.
And, as he remembered the thousands of obscure
destinies hanging over the heads of that crowd, which
had been so stirred by his images of an ideal life, he
congratulated himself on being able to adore alone the
propitious demon that came to visit him secretly, to
offer to him a veiled gift, in the name of an unknown
mistress.</p>

<p>He thrilled at the burst of human voices that saluted
with triumphal acclamation the unvanquished god.</p>

<p class="indent">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viva il forte, viva il grande!</i></p>

<p>The vast hall resounded like a great timbrel, and the
reverberation penetrated through the Censors' Stairway,
the Golden Stairway, the corridors and the vestibules to
the furthermost parts of the palace, like a thunder of
joy echoing in the serene night.</p>

<p class="indent">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viva il forte, viva il grande!<br />
Vincitor dell' Indie dome!</i></p>

<p>It seemed indeed that the chorus was saluting the
apparition of the magnificent god invoked by the poet
on the City Beautiful. It seemed that in those vocal
notes the folds of his purple draperies quivered like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
flames in a crystal tube. The living image hung suspended
over the assemblage, which nourished it with
its own dream.</p>

<p class="indent">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viva il forte, viva il grande!</i></p>

<p>In the impetuous fugue movement, the bass, the contraltos,
the sopranos repeated the frenzied acclamation
to the Immortal of the thousand names and the thousand
crowns, "born on an ineffable bed, like to a young man
in his first youth."</p>

<p>The old Dionysian intoxication seemed born again,
diffusing itself through that divine chorus. The fulness
and freshness of life in the smile of Zeus, who freed
men's souls from sadness, expressed itself in a luminous
outburst of joy. The torches of the Bacchantes blazed
and crackled in the sound. As in an Orphic hymn, the
brightness of conflagration illumined that youthful brow,
surmounted by azure hair. "When the splendor of fire
invaded the whole earth, he alone checked the whirlwinds
of flame." As in the Homeric hymn, there palpitated
the sterile bosom of the sea, expressing in regular
cadences the measured stroke of the oars that propelled
the stout vessel toward unknown lands. The Flower-bearer,
the Fructifier, the visible Remedy for mortal man,
the sacred Flower, The Friend of Pleasure, Dionysius,
the liberator, suddenly appeared before mankind on the
wings of song, crowning for them that nocturnal hour
with happiness, placing before them once more the cup
overflowing with all the good things of life.</p>

<p>The song increased in power; all the voices blended
in the rush of melody. The hymn celebrated the tamer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of tigers, of panthers, lions and lynxes. A cry seemed
to rise from Mænads with heads turned backward, flying
locks and floating robes, who struck their cymbals and
shook their castanets: <em>Evoé!</em></p>

<p>But now suddenly surged above these heroic measures
a broad, pastoral rhythm, invoking the Theban Bacchus,
of the pure brow and gentle thoughts:</p>

<p class="indent">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Quel che all'olmo la vite in stretto nodo<br />
Pronuba accoppia, e i pampini feconda</i> ...</p>

<p>Only two voices, in a succession of sixths, now sang
the flowery nuptials, the leafy marriage, the flexible
bonds. Before the eyes of the multitude again passed
that image already created by the poet of the barque
laden with clusters, like a vat filled with grapes to be
made into wine. And again the song seemed to recall
the miracle witnessed by the prudent pilot Medeia:
"And behold! a sweet and fragrant wine ran over the
swift, black boat.... And behold! a vine climbed
to the top of the sail, and from it hung innumerable
clusters of grapes. And a dark ivy twined about the
mast, and it was covered with flowers, and beautiful
fruits amid their foliage grew thereon, and garlands were
wound about the rowlocks."</p>

<p>The spirit of the fugue then passed into the orchestra,
and mounted in exquisitely light roulades, while the
voices struck on the orchestral web with simultaneous
percussion. And, like a thyrsus waving over the Bacchic
troop, a single voice floated out in the nuptial melody,
with the laughing joy and grace of the pastoral marriage:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<p class="indent poetry">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viva dell'olmo,<br />
E della vite<br />
L'almo fecondo<br />
Sostenitor!</i></p>
</div>

<p>The voices seemed to evoke the image of erect and
graceful Tiades, gently waving their thyrsi in the mists
of divine intoxication, dressed in long saffron-hued robes,
their faces lighted up, ardent as those women of Veronese,
who leaned over their aerial balconies to listen to
the song.</p>

<p>But the heroic acclamation once more sprang up with
final vehemence. The face of the conquering god reappeared
amid torches frantically waved aloft. Then,
in unison, in a supreme burst of joy, voices and orchestra
thundered together at the many-eyed chimera under the
suspended treasure of that dome circled by red triremes,
armed towers, and triumphal bands:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<p class="indent poetry">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viva dell'Indie,<br />
Viva de' mari,<br />
Viva de' mostri<br />
Il domator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Stelio Effrena had gone as far as the threshold;
through the throng that made way before him he penetrated
into the hall and halted near the platform occupied
by the orchestra and the singers. His restless eyes
sought La Foscarina near the celestial sphere, but did
not find her. The head of the Tragic Muse no longer
rose above the constellations. Where was she? To what
place has she withdrawn? Could she see him, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he could not see her? A confused anxiety agitated him,
and the remembrance of the early evening on the water
returned to him indistinctly, accompanied by the words
of her recent promise. Glancing up at the open balconies,
he thought that perhaps she had stepped outside to
breathe the fresh night air, and that, perhaps, leaning
against the balustrade she felt passing over her cool
throat the wave of music, which would seem as sweet
to her as the delight of a kiss from beloved lips.</p>

<p>But his impatience to hear the divine voice dominated
all other impatience, abolished all other desire. He observed
that again a profound silence reigned throughout
the hall, as at the instant when he had opened his lips
to speak his first word. And, as at that instant, the
versatile and ephemeral monster, with a thousand
human faces, seemed to extend itself and yawn to receive
a new soul.</p>

<p>Some one near Stelio whispered the name of Donatella
Arvale. He turned his eyes toward the platform, past
the row of violoncellos, which formed a brown hedge.
The singer remained invisible, hidden in the delicate,
quivering forest of bows, whence would arise the mournful
harmony that must accompany the Lament of
Ariadne.</p>

<p>Amid a sympathetic silence rose a prelude of violins.
Then the viols and violoncellos added a sigh more profound
to that imploring plaint. Was not this&mdash;after the
Phrygian flute and the castanets, after the instruments
of orgies, which trouble the reason and provoke delirium&mdash;was
not this the august Doric lyre, grave and sweet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the harmonious support of song? Thus was the Drama
born from the boisterous Dithyramb. The great metamorphosis
of the Dionysian rite, the frenzy of the sacred
festival before the creative inspiration of the tragic poet,
were figured in that musical alternance. The fiery
breath of the Thracian god gave life to a sublime form
of Art. The crown and the tripod, the prize of the
poet's victory, had displaced the lascivious goat and the
Attic basket of figs. Æschylus, keeper of a vineyard,
had been visited by the god, who had infused into him
his spirit of flame. On the bank of the Acropolis, near
the sanctuary of Dionysius, a marble theater had risen,
capable of containing the chosen people.</p>

<p>Thus suddenly opened in the mind of the Master the
pathways of centuries, extending through the distance
of primitive mysteries. That form of Art, toward which
now tended the effort of his genius, attracted by the
obscure aspirations of human multitudes, appeared to
him in the sanctity of its origins. The divine sadness of
Ariadne, up-springing like a melodious cry from the
furious Thiaros, made leap once more within him the
work he nourished in his soul, unformed yet alive. With
a glance, again he sought the Muse of the revealing voice
against the sphere of constellations, but he did not see
her, and turned once more to the forest of instruments,
whence rose the imploring plaint.</p>

<p>Then, amid the slender bows, that rose and fell upon
the strings with alternating movement, appeared the
singer, erect as a stem; and, like a stem, she seemed
to balance herself an instant on the softened harmony.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The youthfulness of her agile and robust body shone
resplendent through the texture of her robes, as a flame
is seen through the thinness of polished ivory. Rising
and falling around her white form, the bows seemed
to draw their melody from the secret music that dwelt
within her. When her lips opened in an enchanting
curve, Stelio recognized the strength and purity of the
voice before the singer had uttered one modulation, as
if she were a crystal statue wherein he could behold
the unspringing of a jet of living water.</p>

</div>

<p>The melody of a by-gone love and long-dead sorrow
flowed from those lips with an expression so pure and
strong that suddenly, within the soul of the multitude,
it was changed into a mysterious happiness. Was that
strain indeed the divine plaint of the daughter of Minos,
as she held out her arms in vain to the fair Stranger
on the deserted shore of Naxos? The fable vanished;
the illusion of the moment was abolished. The eternal
love and eternal sorrow of gods and of men were exhaled
in that perfect voice. The futile regret for each lost
joy, the recollection of each fugitive blessing, the supreme
prayer flying toward every sail on the sea, toward
every sun hiding itself among the mountains, the implacable
desire and the promise of death&mdash;all these things
passed into the great, solitary song, transformed by the
power of Art into sublime essences which the soul could
receive without suffering. The words were dissolved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in tone, losing their significance, changed into notes of
love and sadness, indefinitely illuminating. Like a circle
that is closed, and yet dilates continually in accordance
with the rhythm of universal life, the melody encircled
the composite soul which dilated with it in immeasurable
joy. Through the open balconies, in the perfect
calm of the autumn night, the enchantment spread over
the peaceful waters and mounted to the watchful stars,
higher than the motionless masts of the ships, higher
than the sacred towers, inhabited by the now silent
bronze bells. During the interludes the singer drooped
her youthful head and stood motionless as a white statue
among the forest of instruments, where the long bows
rose and fell in alternate movement, perhaps unconscious
of that world which in a few brief moments her song
had transfigured.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>THE EPIPHANY OF THE FLAME</small></h2>


<p>Descending to the courtyard hastily, in order
to escape importunate curiosity, Stelio took refuge
in a shadowy corner, to watch, among the
crowd coming down the Giants' Stairway, for
the appearance of the two women, the actress and the
singer, who were to meet him near the well.</p>

<p>Every instant his expectation became more anxious,
while around him rose the tumultuous cry that extended
to the outer walls of the palace and lost itself among
the clouds, now lighted with a glare as of a conflagration.
An almost terrible joy seemed to spread over the Anadyomenean
City, as if a vehement breath had suddenly
dilated all breasts, filling the veins of all men with a
superabundance of life. The repetition of the Bacchic
Chorus celebrating the crown of stars, placed by Aphrodite
on the forgetful head of Ariadne, had drawn a cry
from the throng on the Molo beneath the open balconies.
When, at the final elevation, the word <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viva!</i> rang out
from the chorus of Mænads, Satyrs, and Egipans, the
chorus of the populace had responded to it like a formidable
echo from the harbor of San Marco. And in this
moment of Dionysian delirium it seemed as if the people
remembered the forests of old that were burned on sacred
nights, and had given a signal for the conflagration that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
must light up the beauty of Venice in final, dazzling
splendor.</p>

<p>The dream of Paris Eglano&mdash;the spectacle of marvelous
flames offered to love on a floating couch&mdash;flashed
before Stelio's vision. The persistent image of Donatella
Arvale lingered in his thought: a supple, youthful
figure, strong and shapely, rising erect amid the sonorous
forest of bows, which seemed to draw their notes from
the hidden music within herself. And, seized with a
strange distress, through which passed something like
the shadow of horror, he saw the image of the other
woman: poisoned by art, worn with experience, with the
taste of maturity and worldly corruptness on those eloquent
lips, a feverish dryness in those hands, which had
pressed the juice from deceitful fruits, and with the marks
of a thousand masks on the face that had simulated the
fury of all mortal passions. To-night, at last, after a
long period of waiting and of hope, he was to receive
the gift of that heart, no longer young, which had been
claimed by others before him, but which he never yet
had called his own. How his heart had throbbed in
the early evening as he sat beside that silent woman,
floating toward the City Beautiful over the waters that
seemed to bear them on with the terrifying smoothness
of mysterious machinery. Ah, why did she come now to
meet him in company with the other temptress? Why
did she place beside her despair and worldly wisdom the
pure splendor of innocent youth?</p>

<p>He started suddenly as he perceived in the throng at
the top of the marble staircase, by the light of the smoking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
torches, the form of La Foscarina pressed so closely
against that of Donatella Arvale that the robes of both
blended into one mass of whiteness. He followed them
with his eyes until they reached the lowest stair, anxious
as if at each step they had approached the edge of an
abyss. The unknown during these hours had already
led in the heart of the poet a life so intense that on
seeing her approach him he experienced the emotion that
would have seized him before a breathing incarnation of
one of the ideal creatures born of his art.</p>

<p>She descended slowly on the human wave. Behind
her, the Palace of the Doges, filled with streams of lights
and confused sounds, made one think of those fairy-tale
awakenings which suddenly, in the depths of the forest,
transfigure inaccessible castles where for centuries the
hair on royal heads had grown longer and longer during
a protracted sleep. The two guardian Giants shone
red in the blaze of the torches; the cuspid of the Golden
Gate sparkled with tiny lights. And still the clamor
rose and swelled above the groups of marbles, loud as
the moaning of the stormy sea against the walls of Malamocco.</p>

<p>In this tumult, Effrena saw advancing toward him the
two temptresses, escaping from the crowd as if from
the clasp of a monster. And his fancy pictured extraordinary
assimilations, which should be realized with
the ease of dreams and the solemnity of liturgic ceremonies.
He said to himself that Perdita was leading
this magnificent prey to him, that he might discover
some rarely beautiful secret, that some great work of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
love might be accomplished, in which she desired to be
his fellow artisan. He told himself that this very night
she would say to him most marvelous words. Across
his spirit passed once again the indefinable melancholy
he had felt when he leaned over the bronze rim to contemplate
the reflection of the stars in that dark mirror;
he waited in expectation of some event that should stir
that secret soul in the furthermost depths of his being,
where it lay motionless, strange, intangible. By the
whirling of his thoughts, he comprehended that he was
again plunged into that delirium which the glamor of the
lagoon had given him at twilight. Then, emerging from
the shadowy corner, he went forward to meet the two
women with an intoxicating presentiment.</p>

<p>"Oh, Effrena!" said La Foscarina, as she reached the
well, "I had given up all hope of finding you here. We
are very late, are we not? But we were caught in the
crowd and could not escape."</p>

<p>Then, turning toward her companion with a smile, she
said:</p>

<p>"Donatella, this is the Master of the Flame."</p>

<p>Without speaking, but with a slight smile, Donatella
Arvale responded to the low bow of the young man.</p>

<p>"We must find our gondola," said La Foscarina. "It
is waiting for us at the Ponte della Paglia. Will you
come with us, Effrena? We must profit by the opportunity.
The crowd is rushing toward the Piazzetta. The
Queen will leave by the Porta della Carta."</p>

<p>A long, unanimous cry saluted the appearance of the
fair Queen in her pearls, as she stood at the head of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
stairs, where long ago, in the presence of the populace,
the Doge received the ducal ensign. Again the name of
the white starry flower and the pearl arose from the
crowd and was echoed among the marbles. Flashes of
joy sparkled against the dark sky, a thousand fiery doves
flew from the pinnacles of San Marco, like messengers
of Fire.</p>

<p>"The Epiphany of the Flame!" cried La Foscarina,
as she reached the Molo and gazed upon the marvelous
spectacle.</p>

<p>Donatella Arvale and Stelio Effrena stood side by
side, astonished; then they looked into each other's eyes,
bewildered. And their faces, illumined by the reflections,
shone as if they were leaning over a furnace or a glowing
crater.</p>

<p>All the innumerable appearances of the volatile and
multi-colored Fire spread over the firmament, crept over
the waters, curled around the masts of the ships, enwreathed
the cupolas and the towers, adorned the friezes,
draped the statuary, bejeweled the capitals, enriched
every line and transfigured every aspect of the sacred
and profane architectures around that profound and mysterious
watery mirror, which multiplied these marvels.
The astonished eye could no longer distinguish between
the contour and the quality of the elements, but it was
charmed by a moving vision wherein all forms lived a
lucid, fluid life, suspended in vibrating ether, so that
the slender prows curving over the waves and the myriad
of golden doves against the dark sky seemed to rival
one another in the glory of swift motion, and together to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
reach the summit of immaterial beauty. That which in
the twilight had seemed a silvery palace of Neptune,
built in imitation of a rare shell, at this hour had become
a new temple, erected by the nimble genii of the Fire.
It seemed like one of those labyrinthian constructions
of our dreams, prodigiously enlarged, that rise on andirons,
at the hundred gates of which stand the two-faced
augurs who make ambiguous gestures to the watching
maiden; or like one of those fairy-like red palaces, at
the thousand windows of which appear the faces of salamander
princesses, who smile amorously upon the dreaming
poet.</p>

<p>Rosy as a setting moon, the sphere of the Fortuna,
borne on the shoulders of the Atlantides, radiated on
the triple loggia, its rays engendering a cycle of satellites.
From the Riva, from San Giorgio, from the Giudecca,
with a continual crackling, clusters of fiery stems
rose toward the clouds, and there blossomed into sparkling
roses, lilies, and palms, a flowery paradise, forming
an aerial garden that continually faded and bloomed
again with yet stranger and richer blossoms. It was like
a rapid succession of springs and autumns in the empyrean.
An immense sparkling shower of leaves and petals
fell from the celestial dissolutions, enveloping all things
in its golden shimmer.</p>

<p>From a distance, through gaps in the glittering rain,
a flotilla gay with flags could be seen approaching over
the waters of the lagoon: a fairy-like fleet such as might
float through the dream of a sybarite sleeping his last
sleep on a bed steeped in deadly perfumes. Like those,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
perhaps, their ropes were made from the twisted hair
of slaves captured in conquered cities, and still redolent
of fragrant oils; like those, perhaps, their hulls were
laden with myrrh, spikenard, benzoin, cinnamon, aromatic
herbs; with sandal-wood, cedar, terebinth, and all
oderiferous woods in rich profusion. The indescribable
colors of the flags suggested perfumes and spices. Of
blue-green peacock shades, saffron, violet, and indistinct
hues, those flaming flags seemed to spring from
some burning interior and to have been colored by some
unknown process.</p>

<p>"The Epiphany of the Flame!" repeated La Foscarina.
"What an unforeseen commentary on your poem, Effrena!
The City of Life responds by a miracle to your
act of adoration. She burns, through her watery veil.
Are you not satisfied? Look! Millions of golden pomegranates
are hanging everywhere!"</p>

<p>The actress was smiling, her face illumined by the
magic fire. She was suddenly possessed by that singular
gayety of hers which Stelio knew well, and which, because
of its effect of incongruity with her usual pose,
suggested to him the image of a dark, closed house where
violent hands had suddenly opened on rusty hinges all
the doors and windows.</p>

<p>"We must praise Ariadne," he replied, "for having uttered,
in all this harmony, the most sublime note."</p>

<p>Stelio said those flattering words only to induce the
fair singer to speak, only through a desire to know the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">timbre</i> of that voice when it descended from the heights
of song. But his praise was lost in the reiterated clamor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of the crowd, which overflowed on the Molo, making a
longer stay impossible. From the bank, Stelio assisted
the two friends into their gondola; then he sat down
on a stool at their knees, and the long, dentellated prow
sparkled, like all else, in the magic fire.</p>

<p>"To the Rio Marin, by the Grand Canal," La Foscarina
ordered the gondolier. "Do you know, Effrena, we
are to have at supper some of your best friends: Francesco
de Lizo, Daniele Glauro, Prince Hoditz, Antimo
della Bella, Fabio Molza, Baldassare Stampa"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then it will be a banquet?"</p>

<p>"But not, alas! like that of Cana."</p>

<p>"And will not Lady Myrta, with her Veronese greyhounds,
be there?"</p>

<p>"Rest assured that we shall have Lady Myrta. Did
you not see her in the hall? She sat in the first row,
lost in admiration of you."</p>

<p>Because they had looked into each other's eyes as they
spoke, a sudden emotion seized them. The remembrance
of that full twilight hour on the water that rippled beneath
their oar filled their hearts with a wave of troubled
blood; and each was surprised by a swift return of the
same agitation felt when leaving the silent estuary already
in the power of shadow and death. Their lips
refused to utter vain, light words; their souls refused
to make the effort to incline themselves through prudence
toward the passing trivialities of the superficial
life, which now seemed worthless to both; and their
spirits became absorbed in the contemplation of the
strange fancies that rose from their inmost thoughts in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a garb of indescribable richness, like the heaped-up treasures
the streams of light seemed to reveal in the depths
of the nocturnal waters.</p>

<p>And, because of that very silence, they felt the presence
of the singer weigh heavily upon them, as in the moment
when her name had first been spoken between them; and
little by little the oppression became intolerable. Although
Stelio was seated close to her, she appeared no
less distant than when she rose above the forest of instruments;
she was as absent and unconscious as she
had been when her voice soared high in song. She had
not yet spoken.</p>

<p>Simply to hear her speak, and almost timidly, Stelio
said:</p>

<p>"Shall you remain some time longer in Venice?"</p>

<p>He had pondered on the first words he should say
to her, but was dissatisfied with whatever rose to his
lips, for all phrases seemed too vivid, insidious, full of
ambiguous significance, capable of infinite changes and
transformations, like the unknown seed from which may
spring a thousand roots. And it seemed to him that
Perdita could not hear one of those phrases without feeling
that a shadow darkened her love.</p>

<p>After he had spoken those simple, conventional words,
he reflected that even that question might suggest an
infinity of hope and eagerness.</p>

<p>"I must leave Venice to-morrow," Donatella replied.
"I ought not to be here even now."</p>

<p>Her voice, so clear and powerful in the heights of song,
was low and sober, as if suffused with a slight opacity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
suggesting the image of the most precious metal wrapped
in the most delicate velvet. Her brief reply indicated
that there was a place of suffering to which she must
return, where she must undergo some familiar torture.
Like iron tempered with tears, a strong though sorrowful
will shone through the veil of her youthful beauty.</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" Stelio exclaimed, not seeking to hide
his sincere regret. "Have you heard, Signora?"</p>

<p>"I know," the actress replied, gently taking Donatella's
hand. "I am filled with regret to see her go. But
she cannot remain away longer from her father. Perhaps
you do not yet know"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What?" asked Stelio quickly. "Is he ill? Is it true,
then, that Lorenzo Arvale is ill?"</p>

<p>"No, he is only fatigued," said La Foscarina, touching
her forehead with a gesture perhaps involuntary but
which revealed to Stelio the horrible menace hanging
over the genius of the artist who had seemed as fertile
and indefatigable as one of the old masters&mdash;a Della
Robbia or a Verrocchio.</p>

<p>"He is only fatigued," repeated La Foscarina. "He
needs repose and quiet. And his daughter's singing is
very soothing to him. Do you not believe, also, Effrena,
in the healing power of music?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Stelio replied, "Ariadne possesses a divine
gift whereby her power transcends all limits."</p>

<p>The name of Ariadne came spontaneously to his lips
to indicate the singer as she appeared to his fancy, for
it seemed to him impossible to pronounce the young
girl's real name preceded by the ordinary appellation imposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
by social usage. In his eyes she was perfect and
singular, free from the little ties of custom, living her
own sequestered life, like a work of art on which style
had set its inviolable seal. He thought of her as isolated
like those figures that stand out with clear contour, far
from common life, lost in mystic reverie; and already,
before that impenetrable character, he felt a sort of passionate
impatience, somewhat similar to that of a curious
man before something hermetically sealed that tempts
him.</p>

<p>"Ariadne had for the soothing of her griefs the gift
of forgetfulness," said Donatella, "and that I do not possess."</p>

<p>A bitterness perhaps involuntary infused these words,
in which Stelio fancied he detected the indication
of an aspiration toward a life less oppressed by useless
suffering. He guessed at her revolt against a certain
form of domestic slavery, the horror of her self-imposed
sacrifice, her vehement desire to rise toward joy, and her
inborn aptitude for being drawn like a beautiful bow by
a strong hand that would know how to use it for some
high conquest. He divined that she had no longer any
hope of her father's recovery, and that she was saddened
at the thought that henceforth she could only be the
guardian of a darkened hearth, of ashes without a spark.
The image of the great artist rose in his mind, not as he
was, since Stelio never had known him personally, but
such as he had fancied the sculptor after studying his
ideas of beauty expressed in imperishable bronze and
marble. His mind fixed itself on that image with a sensation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of terror more icy than that which the most appalling
aspects of death could have inspired. And all his
strength, all his pride and his ardor seemed to resound
within him like weapons shaken by a menacing hand,
sending a quiver through every fiber of his heart.</p>

<p>Presently La Foscarina lifted the funereal black curtain,
which suddenly, amid the splendors of the festival,
had seemed to change the gondola into a coffin.</p>

<p>"Look!" she said, pointing out to Stelio the balcony
of Desdemona's palace: "See the beautiful Nineta receiving
the homage of the Serenade, as she sits between
her pet monkey and her little dog."</p>

<p>"Ah, the beautiful Nineta!" said Stelio, rousing himself
from his wild thoughts, and saluting the smiling occupant
of the balcony, a little woman who was listening
to the music, her face illumined from two silver candelabra,
from the branches of which hung wreaths of
the last roses of the year. "I have not yet seen her
this time. She is the gentlest and most graceful animal
I know. How fortunate was our dear Howitz to discover
her behind the lid of an old harpsichord when he was
rummaging in that curiosity shop at San Samuele! Two
pieces of good fortune in one day: the lovely Nineta and
a harpsichord lid painted by Pordenone. Since that day,
the harmony of his life has been complete. How I should
like to have you penetrate to his nest! You would find
there a perfect example of that which I spoke of this
evening, at twilight. There is a man who, by obeying
his native taste for simplicity, has arranged for himself
with minute art his own little love-story, in which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
lives as happily as did his Moravian ancestor in the Arcady
of Rosswald. Ah! I know a thousand exquisite
things about him!"</p>

<p>A large gondola, decorated with many-colored lanterns,
and laden with singers and musicians, had stopped
beneath the balcony of Desdemona's house. The old
song of brief youth and fleeting beauty rose sweetly toward
the little woman who listened with her child-like
smile, sitting between the monkey and the lapdog, making
a group like one of Pietro Longhi's prints.</p>

</div>

<p>"Does it not seem to you, Effrena, that these surroundings
express the true soul of Venice, and that the
other picture, which you presented to the multitude, is
only your own fancy?" said La Foscarina, nodding her
head slightly in time with the rhythm of the sweet
song that spread through the Grand Canal and was reechoed
from afar by singers in other gondolas.</p>

<p>"No," Stelio replied, "this does not at all represent
the true soul of Venice. In each one of us, fluttering like
a butterfly over the surface of our deeper nature, is a
lighter soul, an <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">animula</i>, a little playful sprite that often
dominates us for the moment, and leads us toward simple
and mediocre pleasures, toward puerile pastimes and
frivolous music. This <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animula vagula</i> exists even in the
gravest and most violent natures, like the clown attached
to the person of Othello; and sometimes it misleads our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
better judgment. That which you hear now, in the songs
and the melodies of the guitars, is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animula</i>, or lighter
spirit, of Venice; but her real soul is discovered only
in silence, and most terribly, be assured, in full summer,
at noonday, like the soul of the great god Pan. Out in
the harbor of San Marco, I thought that you felt its
mystic vibration during those moments of the great conflagration.
You are forgetting Giorgione for Rosalba!"</p>

<p>Around the large gondola beneath the balcony had
gathered other gondolas bearing languid women who
leaned out to listen to the music in attitudes of graceful
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">abandon</i>, as if in fancy they felt themselves sinking into
invisible arms. And around this romantic group the reflections
of the lanterns in the water quivered like a
flowering of rare and luminous water-lilies.</p>

<p>It was, in truth, the song of the last roses that entwined
the candelabra. It called up in Perdita's mind the funeral
cortège of the dead Summer, the opalescent veil in
which Stelio had wrapped the sweet body in its golden
robe. Through the glass, sealed by the Master of Fire,
she could see her own image at the bottom of the lagoon,
lying on a field of seaweed. A sudden chill stole over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
her; once more she felt horror and disgust of her own
body, no longer young. And, remembering her recent
promise, thinking that perhaps this very night the beloved
one would claim its fulfilment, she shuddered with
a sort of sorrowful modesty, a mingling of fear and pride.
Her experience and despairing eyes ran over the young
girl beside her, studying her, penetrating her, realizing
her occult but certain power, her intact freshness, pure
health, and that indefinable virtue of love that emanates
like an aroma from chaste maidens when they have arrived
at the perfection of their bloom. She felt that
some secret current of affinity existed between this fair
creature and the poet; she could almost divine the words
he addressed to her in the silence of his heart. A bitter
pang seized her, so intolerable that, with an involuntary
movement, her fingers clutched convulsively the black
rope of the arm-rest beside her, so that the little metal
griffin that held it creaked audibly.</p>

<p>This movement did not escape Stelio's anxious vigilance.
He understood her agitation, and for a moment he
experienced the same pang, but it was mingled with impatience
and almost with anger, for her anguish, like a
cry of destruction, interrupted the fiction of transcendent
life that he had been constructing within himself in order
to conciliate the contrast, to conquer this new force that
offered itself to him like a bow to be drawn, yet at the
same time not to lose the savor of that ripe maturity
which life had impregnated with all its essences, and the
benefit of that devotion and that passionate faith which
sharpened his intelligence and fed his pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, Perdita!" he said to himself, "From the ferment
of your human loves, why has not a love more than
human sprung. Ah, why have I finally vanquished you
by my pleading, although I know it is too late? and why
do you allow me to read in your eyes the certainty of
your yielding, amid a flood of doubts which, nevertheless,
never again will have power to reëstablish the abolished
interdiction. Each of us knows full well that that
interdiction conferred the highest dignity upon our long
communion, yet we have not known how to preserve its
rule, and at the last hour we yield blindly to an imperious
internal call. Yet, a short time ago, when your noble head
dominated the belt of constellations, I no longer saw
in you an earthly love, but the illuminating, revelatory
Muse of my poetry; and all my heart went out to you
in gratitude, not for the promise of a fleeting happiness,
but for the promise of glory. Do you not understand&mdash;you,
who understand everything? By a marvelous inspiration,
such as always comes to you, have you not
turned my inclination, by the ray of your smile, toward
a resplendent youthfulness which you have chosen and
reserved for me? When you descended the stairway together,
and approached me, had you not the appearance
of one that bears a gift or an unexpected message? Not
wholly unexpected, perhaps, Perdita! For I have anticipated
from your infinite wisdom some extraordinary
action toward me."</p>

<p>"How happy the beautiful Nineta is, with her monkey
and her little dog!" sighed the actress, looking back at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the light songsters and the smiling woman on the balcony.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>Donatella Arvale and Stelio also looked back, while
the light barque, without sinking, bore over the water
and past the music the three faces of a heavy destiny.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>Suddenly, in front of the red palace of the Foscari,
at the curve of the canal, they saw the state vessel of
the Doge of Venice so brightly illumined that it looked
like a burning tower. New streaks of fire flashed against
the sky. Other flaming doves flew up from the deck,
rose above the terraces, sank among the statues, hissed
as they fell into the water, multiplied themselves in
thousands of sparks, and floated along in smoke. Along
the parapets, from the decks, the poop, the prow, in a
simultaneous explosion, a thousand fountains of fire
opened, dilated, blended, illuminating with an intense,
fiery radiance each side of the canal as far as San Vitale
and the Rialto. Then the vessel of the Doge glided
out of sight, transformed into a purple thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>"Go through San Polo!" called La Foscarina to the
gondolier, bending her head as under a storm, and shutting
out the roar with her palms over her ears.</p>

<p>Again Donatella Arvale and Stelio Effreno looked at
each other with dazzled eyes. Again their faces, lighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
by the glare, glowed as if they were leaning over a furnace
or a burning crater.</p>

<p>The gondola turned into the canal of San Polo, gliding
along through the darkness. A cold shadow seemed
suddenly to fall over the spirits of the three silent occupants.
Under the arch of the bridge, the hollow echo
of the dipping oar struck upon their souls, and the hilarity
of the festival sounded infinitely far-away. All the
houses were dark; the campanile rose silent and solitary
toward the stars; the Campiello del Remer and the
Campiello del Pistor were deserted, and the grass
breathed there in untrodden peace; the trees, bending
over the low walls of the little gardens, seemed to feel
their leaves dying on the branches pointing to the serene
sky.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>THE POET'S DREAM</small></h2>


<p>"So, for a few hours at least, the rhythm of
Art and the pulse of Life have again
throbbed in unison in Venice," said Daniele
Glauro, raising from the table an exquisite
chalice, to which only the Sacred Host was wanting.
"Allow me to express, for myself and also for the many
that are absent, the gratitude and fervor that blend in
one single image of beauty the three persons to whom
we owe this miracle: the mistress of the feast, the daughter
of Lorenzo Arvale, and the poet of Persephone."</p>

<p>"And why the mistress of the feast, Glauro?" asked
La Foscarina, smiling in graceful surprise. "I, like you,
have not given joy, but have received it. Donatella and
the Master of the Flame: they alone merit the crown;
and to them alone the glory must be given."</p>

<p>"But, a short time ago, in the Hall of the Greater
Council," said the mystic doctor, "your silent presence
beside the celestial sphere was not less eloquent than
the words of Stelio, nor less musical than the song of
Ariadne. Once again you have divinely carved your own
statue in silence, and it will live in our memories blended
with the music and the words."</p>

<p>Stelio shuddered as he recalled to mind the ephemeral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
flexible monster from the side of which had emerged the
Tragic Muse above the sphere of constellations.</p>

<p>"That is true, very true," said Francesco de Lizo. "I,
too, had the same thought. As we looked at you, we all
realized that you were the soul of that ideal world which
each of us forms for himself, according to his own aspirations
and thoughts when listening to the mystic
word, the song, the symphony."</p>

<p>"And each of us," said Fabio Molza, "felt that in your
presence, dominating the throng, before the poet, dwelt
a great and rare significance."</p>

<p>"One might almost have said that you alone were
about to assist at the mysterious birth of a new idea,"
said Antimo della Bella. "Everything around us seemed
awakening itself to produce it&mdash;that idea which must
soon be revealed to us, as a reward for the profound
faith with which we have awaited it."</p>

<p>The Animator, with another trembling of the heart,
felt the work that he cherished within him leap once
more, formless yet, but already living; and his whole
soul, as if impelled by a lyric breath, suddenly felt drawn
toward the fertile and enlightening power that emanated
from the Dionysian woman to whom these fervent spirits
addressed their praise.</p>

<p>Suddenly she had become very beautiful: a nocturnal
creature, fashioned by dreams and passion on a golden
anvil, living embodiment of immortal fate and eternal
enigmas. She might remain motionless and silent, but
her famous accents and her memorable gestures seemed
to live around her, vibrating indefinitely, as melodies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
seem to hover over the cords accustomed to sound them,
as rhymes seem to breathe from the poet's closed book,
wherein love and sorrow seek comfort and intoxication.
The heroic fidelity of Antigone, the oracular fury of Cassandra,
the devouring fever of Phædre, the cruelty of
Medea, the sacrifice of Iphigenia, Myrrha before her
father, Polyxenes and Alceste before the face of death,
Cleopatra, fitful as the wind and the fires of the world,
Lady Macbeth, the dreamy murderess with the little
hands; and those great, fair lilies empearled with dew
and tears&mdash;Imogen, Juliet, Miranda, Rosalind, Jessica,
and Perdita&mdash;the tenderest, most terrible, and most magnificent
souls dwelt within her, inhabited her body,
shone from her eyes, breathed through her lips, which
knew both honey and poison, the jeweled chalice and the
cup of wormwood. Thus, through unlimited space, and
endless, the outlines of human life and substance appeared
to perpetuate themselves; and from the simple
movement of a muscle, a sign, a start, a quiver of the
eyelids, a slight change of color, an almost imperceptible
inclination of the head, a fugitive play of light and shade,
a lightning-like virtue of expression radiating from that
frail and slender body, infinite worlds of imperishable
beauty were continually generated.</p>

<p>The genii of the places consecrated by poetry hovered
around her, and encircled her with changing visions:
the dusty plain of Thebes, the arid Argolide, the parched
myrtles of Trezene, the sacred olives of Colonus, the
triumphant Cydnus, the pale country of Dunsinane,
Prospero's cavern, the Forest of Arden, land dampened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
with blood, toiled upon with pain, transfigured by a
dream or illumined by an inextinguishable smile, seemed
to appear, to recede, then to vanish behind her head.
And a vision of countries still more remote&mdash;regions of
mists, northern lands, and, far across the ocean, the immense
continent where she had appeared like an unknown
force amid astonished multitudes, bearer of the
mystic word and the flame of genius&mdash;vanished behind
her head: the throngs, the mountains, rivers and gulfs,
the impure cities, the ancient, enfeebled, savage race, the
strong people aspiring to dominate the world, the new
nation that wrests from Nature her most secret energies
to make them serve an all-powerful work in erecting edifices
of iron and of crystal; the bastard colonies that
ferment and grow corrupt on virgin soil; all the barbarous
crowds she had visited as the messenger of Latin
genius; all the ignorant masses to whom she had spoken
the sublime language of Dante; all the human herds
from which had mounted toward her, on a wave of confused
anxieties and desires, the aspiration to Beauty.</p>

<p>She stood there, a creature of perishable flesh, subject
to the sad laws of time, but an illimitable mass of reality
and poetry weighed upon her, surged around her, palpitated
with the rhythm of her breath. And not upon
the stage alone had she uttered her cries and suppressed
her sobs: this had entered into her daily life. She had
loved, fought and suffered violently, in her soul and in
her body. What loves? What combats? What pangs?
From what abysses of melancholy had she drawn the
exaltations of her tragic force? At what springs of bitterness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
had she watered her free genius? She had certainly
witnessed the crudest misery, the darkest ruin;
she had known heroic effort, pity, horror, and the threshold
of death. All her thirst had burned in the delirium
of Phædre, and in the submissiveness of Imogen had
trembled all her tenderness. Thus Life and Art, the irrevocable
Past and the eternal Present, had made her
profound, many-souled, and mysterious, had magnified
her ambiguous destiny beyond human limits, and rendered
her equal to great temples and natural forests.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she stood there, a living, breathing
woman, under the gaze of the poets, each of whom saw
her, and yet in her many others.</p>

<p>"Ah! I will embrace you as in some mad revelry; I
will clasp you, shake you; from your ripe experience, I
will draw all the divine and abnormal secrets that weigh
upon you&mdash;the things you have already done, and those
on which you still meditate in the mysterious depths of
your soul," sang the lyric demon in the ear of the poet,
who recognized in the mystery of this woman the surviving
power of primitive myth, the renewed initiation
of the god that had concentrated in one single ferment
all the energies of Nature, and, by a variety of rhythms,
had raised, in an enthusiastic worship of himself, the
senses and the spirit of man to the highest summits of
joy and of pain.</p>

<p>"I have done well, I have done wisely, to wait!" said
Stelio to himself. "The passing of years, the tumult of
dreams, the agitation of struggle and the swiftness of
triumph, the experience of many loves, the enchantment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of poets, the acclamations of the people; the marvels of
earth, the patience and the fury, the steps in the mud,
the blind flight, all evil, all good, that which I know and
do not know, that which you know, as well as that
which you are ignorant of&mdash;all this had to be to prepare
the fulness of this night, which belongs to me!"</p>

<p>He felt himself suffocate and turn pale. A wild impulse
seized him by the throat, and would not relax its
hold. His heart swelled with the same keen emotion
that had possessed both in the twilight, as they floated
over the water.</p>

<p>And, as the exaggerated radiance of the city and the
event had suddenly disappeared, the glory of this woman
of the night reappeared to his mind still more closely
blended with the city of the wonderful necklaces and
the thousand emerald girdles. In the city and in the
woman, the poet now saw a power of expression that
he never had seen before: each glowed in the Autumn
night; the same feverish fire that coursed through the
canals ran also in her veins.</p>

<p>The stars sparkled, the trees waved their branches behind
Perdita's head, back of which were the shadows of
a garden. Through the open balconies the sweet air of
heaven entered the room; shook the flames of the candelabra
and the chalices of flowers; swept through the
doorways, making the draperies wave to and fro, animating
that old house of the Capello, wherein the last great
daughter of San Marco whom the people had covered
with gold and glory had gathered relics of republican
magnificence. Galleon lamps, Turkish targets, bronze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
helmets, leathern quivers, and velvet scabbards ornamented
the apartments inhabited by the last descendant
of that marvelous Cesare Darbes who maintained the Art
of Comedy against the Goldonian reform, and changed
the agony of the Most Serene Republic into a burst of
laughter.</p>

<p>"I only ask that I may be the humble servitor of that
idea," was La Foscarina's reply to Antimo della Bella's
words. Her voice trembled a little, her eyes had met
Stelio's gaze.</p>

<p>"You alone could make it triumphant," said Francesco
de Lizo. "The soul of the people is yours forever."</p>

<p>"The drama can only be a rite or a message," declared
Glauro sententiously. "Acting should again become
as solemn as a religious ceremony, since it embraces
the two constituent elements of all worship: the
living person, in whom, on the stage as before an altar,
the word of the revealer is made incarnate, before a multitude
as silent as if in a temple"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bayreuth!" interrupted Prince Hoditz.</p>

<p>"No; the Janiculum!" exclaimed Stelio, suddenly breaking
his silence of blissful dizziness. "A Roman hill. We
do not need the wood and brick of Upper Franconia;
we will have a marble theater on a Roman hill."</p>

<p>The sudden opposition of his words seemed to spring
from a light, good-natured disdain.</p>

<p>"Do you not admire the work of Richard Wagner?"
Donatella Arvale inquired, with a slight frown that for
a moment made her Hermes-like face look almost hard.</p>

<p>Stelio looked deep into her eyes; he felt that there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
something obscurely hostile in the young girl's manner,
and also that he himself experienced against her an indistinct
suggestion of enmity. At this moment he again
saw her living her own isolated life, fixed in some deep,
secret thought, strange and inviolable.</p>

<p>"The work of Richard Wagner," he replied, "is founded
in the German spirit, and its essence is purely northern.
His reform is not without analogy with that attempted
by Luther; his drama is the supreme flower of the genius
of a race, the extraordinarily powerful summary of the
aspirations that have stirred the souls of the symphonists
and national poets, from Bach to Beethoven, from Wieland
to Goethe. If you could imagine his work on the
Mediterranean shores, amid our pale olive-trees, our
slender laurels, under the glorious light of the Latin
sky, you would see it grow pale and dissolve. Since,
according to his own words, it is given to the artist to
behold a world as yet unformed resplendent in its future
perfection, and to enjoy it prophetically through
desire and through hope, I announce to you the coming
of a new, or rather a renewed, art which, by the strong,
sincere simplicity of its lines, by its vigorous grace,
by its ardor of inspiration, by the pure power of its
harmonies, will continue and crown the immense ideal
edifice of our elect race. I glory in being Latin, and&mdash;will
you pardon me, most exquisite Lady Myrta, and
you, my delicate Hoditz?&mdash;in every man of different
blood I see a barbarian."</p>

<p>"But Wagner, too," said, Baldassare Stampa, who, having
just returned from Bayreuth, was still full of ecstasy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
"when he first unwound the thread of his theories, departed
from the Greeks."</p>

<p>"It was an uneven and a tangled thread," the poet replied.
"Nothing is further from the Orestiades than the
tetralogy of the Ring. The Florentines of the Casa
Bardi have penetrated much deeper into the true meaning
of Greek tragedy. All honor to the Camerata of
the Conte di Vernio!"</p>

<p>"I have always thought that the Camerata was only
an idle reunion of scholars and rhetoricians," said Baldassare
Stampa.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that, Daniele?" exclaimed Stelio, addressing
the mystic doctor. "When was there in the
world a more fervid intelligence? They sought the spirit
of life in Grecian antiquity; they tried to develop harmoniously
all human energies, to manifest man in his
integrity by every method of art. Giulio Caccini taught
that that, which contributed to the excellence of the
musician is not only the study of particular things, but
of everything in general; the tawny hair of Jacopo Peri
and of Zazzerino flamed in their song like that of Apollo.
In the discourse that serves as a preface to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Rappresentazione
di Anima et di Corpo</i>, Emilio del Cavaliere presents
the same ideas on the organization of the new
theater that have since been realized at Bayreuth, comprising
the rules of perfect silence, an invisible orchestra,
and appropriate darkness. Marco da Gagliano, in celebrating
a festal performance, eulogizes all the arts that
contributed to it 'in such a way that through the intellect
all the noblest sentiments are flattered at the same time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
by the most delightful art that the human mind has discovered.'
That is sufficient, I think."</p>

<p>"Bermino," resumed Francesco de Lizo, "presented an
opera in Rome, for which he himself built the theater,
painted the decorations, carved the ornamental statues,
invented the machinery, wrote the words, composed the
music, arranged the dances, rehearsed the actors, and in
which he, too, danced, sang, and acted."</p>

<p>"Enough! Enough!" cried Prince Hoditz, laughing.
"The barbarian is vanquished."</p>

<p>"No, that is not yet enough," said Antimo della Bella;
"it remains to us to glorify the greatest of all these innovators;
him that was consecrated a Venetian by his
passion and death, him whose tomb is in the Church
of the Frari, and is worthy of a pilgrimage&mdash;the divine
Claudio Monteverde."</p>

<p>"There was a heroic soul, of pure Italian essence,"
warmly acceded Daniele Glauro.</p>

<p>"He accomplished his work in the tempest, loving, suffering,
struggling, alone with his faith, his passion, and
his genius," said La Foscarina slowly, as if absorbed in
a vision of that sad and courageous life that had nourished
the creations of its art with its warmest blood.
"Tell us about him, Effrena."</p>

<p>Stelio thrilled as if she had suddenly touched him.
Again her expressive mouth called up an ideal figure,
which rose as if from a sepulcher before the eyes of the
poets, with the color and the breath of life. The ancient
viola-player, bereaved, ardent, and sorrowful, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Orpheus of his own fable, seemed to appear before them.</p>

<p>It was a fiery apparition, more fervid and dazzling
than that which had glowed in the harbor of San Marco;
a flaming force of life, expelled from the deepest recesses
of Nature toward the expectant multitude; a vehement
zone of light, flashing out from an interior sky to illumine
the most secret depths of human will and desire;
an unheard word emerging from original silence to say
that which is eternal and eternally ineffable in the heart
of the world.</p>

<p>"Who could speak of him, even if he himself should
speak to us?" said the Inspirer, agitated, unable to conceal
the wave of emotion surging in his soul like the
troubled waters of a stormy sea.</p>

<p>He looked at the singer, and beheld her as she had appeared
during the pauses, when she stood amid the forest
of instruments, white and inanimate as a statue.</p>

<p>But the spirit of Beauty they had called up was to
manifest itself through her.</p>

<p>"Ariadne!" Stelio murmured, as if to awaken her from
a dream.</p>

<p>She arose without speaking, reached the door, and entered
the adjoining room. The light sweep of her skirts
and her soft footfall were audible; then they heard the
sound of the piano being opened. All were silent and
expectant. A musical silence filled the vacant place in
the supper-room. A sudden gust of wind shook the
flames of the candles and swayed the flowers. Then
all became motionless in the anxiety of anticipation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<p class="indent poetry">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lasciatemi morire!</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly their souls were ravished by a power comparable
to the strength of the eagle which, in Dante's
dream, bore the poet to the region of flame. They
burned together in eternal truth; they heard the melody
of the world pass through their luminous ecstasy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<p class="indent poetry">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lasciatemi morire!</i></p>
</div>

<p>Was it Ariadne, still Ariadne, weeping in some new
grief, still rising to higher martyrdom?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<p class="indent poetry">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">E che volete<br />
Che mi conforte<br />
In cosa dure sorte,<br />
In cosi gran martire?<br />
Lasciatemi morire!</i></p>
</div>

<p>The voice ceased; the singer did not reappear. The
aria of Claudio Monteverde composed itself in the auditors'
memories like an immutable lineament.</p>

<p>"Is there any Greek marble that has a perfection of
style more sure and simple?" said Daniele Glauro softly,
as if he feared to break the musical silence.</p>

<p>"But what sorrow on earth ever has wept like that?"
stammered Lady Myrta, her eyes full of tears, that ran
down her poor, pale cheeks, which she wiped with her
trembling hands, misshaped by gout.</p>

<p>The austere intellect of the ascetic and the sweet, sensitive
soul shut within the old, infirm body bore witness
to the same power. In the same way, nearly three centuries
before, at Mantua, in the famous theater, six thousand
spectators had been unable to repress their sobs;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and the poets had believed in the living presence of
Apollo on the new stage.</p>

<p>"See, Baldassare," said Stelio, "here is an artist of our
own race who by the simplest means succeeded in attaining
the highest degree of that beauty which the
German but rarely approached in his confused aspirations
toward the land of Sophocles."</p>

<p>"Do you know the lament of the ailing king?" asked
the young man with the sunny locks, which he wore long
as a heritage from the Venetian Sappho, the "high Gaspara,"
unfortunate friend of Collalto.</p>

<p>"All the agony of Amfortas is contained in a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mottetto</i>
that I know: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peccantem me quotidie</i>, but with what lyric
impetus, what powerful simplicity! All the forces of
tragedy are there, sublimated, so to speak, like the instincts
of a multitude in a heroic heart. The language
of Palestrina, much more ancient, appears to me still
purer and more virile.</p>

<p>"But the contrast between Kundry and Parsifal, in
the second act, the Herzeleide <em>motif</em>, the impetuous figure,
that figure of pain drawn from the word of the sacred
feast, the <em>motif</em> of Kundry's aspiration, the prophetic
theme of the promise, the kiss on the lips of the 'pure
fool,' all that rending and intoxicating contrast of desire
and horror.... 'The wound, the wound! Now
it burns, now it bleeds within me!' And above the despairing
frenzy of the temptress, the melody of submission:
'Let me weep on thy breast! Let me unite myself
with thee for one hour; then, even if God repel me,
through thee I shall be redeemed and saved.' And Parsifal's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
response, in which the <em>motif</em> of the 'pure fool,' now
transfigured into the promised Hero, returns with lofty
solemnity: 'Hell would be our fate for all eternity if
for one single hour I should permit thee to clasp me
in thy arms.' Then the wild ecstasy of Kundry: 'Since
my kiss has made thee a prophet, embrace me wholly,
and my love will render thee divine! One hour, one
single hour with thee, and I shall be saved!' And the
last effort of her demoniac will, the last gesture of enticement,
the entreaty and the furious words: 'Only thy
love can save me! Oh, let me love thee! Mine for a
single hour! Thine for a single hour!'"</p>

<p>Perdita and Stelio, entranced, gazed into each other's
eyes; for an instant their spirits rushed together and
mingled, in all the joy of an actual embrace.</p>

<p>La Marangona, the largest bell of San Marco, sounded
midnight, and, as at the eventide, the two enamored
ones felt the reverberation of the bronze bell in the
roots of their hair, almost like a quiver of their own
flesh. Once more they felt, hovering over them, the
whirlwind of sound, in the midst of which, in the twilight,
they had suddenly become aware of the rising apparition
of consoling Beauty, evoked by unanimous prayer.
All the beauty of the waters, the timidity of concealed
longing, the anxiety, the promise, the parting, the festival,
the formidable, many-headed monster, the great,
starry sphere, the clamor, the music, the song, and the
wonders of the miraculous Flame, the return through
the echoing canal, the song of brief youth, the mental
struggle and silent agitation in the gondola, the sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
shadow over their three destinies, the banquet illumined
by beautiful thought, the presentiments, hopes, pride, all
the strongest pulsations of life were renewed between
those two, quickened, became a thousand, and again one.
They felt that in that one moment they had lived beyond
all human limits, and that before them was opening
a vast unknown, which they might absorb as the
ocean absorbs, for, though they had lived so much, they
felt their hearts were empty; though they had drunk
so deep, they were still athirst. An overmastering illusion
seized upon these rich natures, and each seemed
to grow immeasurably more desirable in the other's eyes.
The young girl had disappeared. The expression of the
despairing, nomadic actress seemed to repeat: "Embrace
me wholly, and my love will render thee divine! One
hour, one single hour with thee, and I shall be saved!
Mine for a single hour! Thine for a single hour!"</p>

<p>The eloquent commentary of the enthusiast still dwelt
upon the sacred tragedy. Kundry, the mad temptress,
the slave of desire, the Rose of Hell, the original perdition,
the accursed, now reappeared in the spring dawn;
she reappeared humble and pale in her messenger's attire,
her head bent, her eyes cast down; and her harsh,
broken voice spoke only the single phrase: "Let me
serve! Let me serve!"</p>

<p>The melodies of solitude, of submission, of purification
prepared around her humility the enchantment of
Good Friday. And behold Parsifal, in black armor and
closed helmet, his spear lowered, lost in an infinite
dream: "I have come by perilous paths, but perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
this day I shall be saved, since I hear the murmur of
the sacred forest." ... Hope, pain, remorse, memory,
the promise, faith panting for the soul's health, and the
sacred, mysterious melodies wove the ideal mantle that
should cover the Simple One, the Pure, the promised
Hero sent to heal the incurable wound. "Wilt thou take
me to Amfortas to-day?" He languished and fainted in
the old man's arms. "Let me serve! Let me serve!"
The melody of submission rose again from the orchestra,
drowning the original impetuous <em>motif</em>. "Let me serve!"
The faithful woman brings water, kneels humbly and
eagerly, and washes the feet of her beloved. The faithful
one drew from her bosom a vase of balm, anointed
the beloved feet, and wiped them with her flowing hair.
"Let me serve!" The Pure One bent over the sinner,
sprinkling water on her wild head: "Thus I accomplish
my first office; receive this baptism and believe in the
Redeemer!" Kundry burst into tears, and knelt with
her brow in the dust, freed from impurity, freed from
the curse. And then, from the profound final harmonies
of the prayer to the Redeemer, rose and spread with
superhuman sweetness the melody of the flowery fields:
"How beautiful to-day is the meadow! Once I was entwined
with marvelous flowers; but never before were
the grass and wild blossoms so fragrant!" In ecstasy,
Parsifal contemplated the fields and forests, dewy and
smiling in the light of morn.</p>

<p>"Ah! who could forget that sublime moment?" cried
the fair-haired enthusiast, whose thin face seemed to
reflect the light of that joy. "All, in the darkness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the theater, remained motionless, like one solid, compact
mass. One would have said that, in order to listen
to that marvelous music, the blood had ceased to flow in
our veins. From the Mystic Gulf, the symphony rose
like a shaft of light, the notes transformed into rays of
sunshine, born with the same joy as the blade of grass
that pierces the earth, the opening flower, the budding
branch, the insect unfolding its wings. And all the innocence
of new-born things entered into us, and our
souls lived over again I know not what dream of our
far-away childhood.... INFANTIA, the device
of Carpaccio! Ah, Stelio! how well you brought it
back to our riper age! How well you knew how to inspire
us with regret for all that we have lost, and with
hope of recovering it by means of an art that shall be
indissolubly reunited to life!"</p>

<p>Stelio Effrena was silent, oppressed by the thought
of the gigantic work accomplished by the barbaric creator,
which the enthusiasm of Baldassare Stampa had
evoked as a contrast to the fervid poet of <cite>Orpheus</cite> and
of <cite>Ariadne</cite>. A kind of instinctive rancor, an obscure
hostility that did not spring from the intellect, sustained
him against the tenacious German who had succeeded,
by his own unaided effort, in inflaming the world. To
achieve his victory over men and things, he, too, had
exalted his own image and magnified his own dreams
of dominating beauty. He, too, had approached the
multitude as if it were his chosen prey; he, too, had
imposed upon himself, as if it were a discipline, an unceasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
effort to surpass himself. And now he had the
temple of his creed on the Bavarian hill.</p>

<p>"Art alone can lead men back to unity," said Daniele
Glauro. "Let us honor the nobler master that has proclaimed
this dogma for all time. His Festival Theater,
though built of bricks and wood, though narrow and
imperfect, has none the less a sublime significance, for
within it Art appears as a religion in a living form; the
drama there becomes a rite."</p>

<p>"Yes, let us honor Richard Wagner," said Antimo
della Bella, "but, if this hour is to be memorable by an
announcement and a promise from him who this night
has shown the mysterious ship to the people, let us invoke
once more the heroic soul that has spoken to us
through the voice of Donatella Arvale. In laying the
corner-stone of his Festival Theater, the poet of <cite>Siegfried</cite>
consecrated it to the hopes and victories of Germany.
The Apollo Theater, which is now rising rapidly
on the Janiculum, where eagles once descended, bearing
their prophecies, must be the monumental revelation of
the idea toward which our race is led by its genius. Let
us reaffirm the privilege with which nature has ennobled
our Latin blood."</p>

<p>Still Stelio remained silent, deeply stirred by turbulent
forces that worked within his soul with a sort of blind
fury, like the subterranean energies that swell, rend, and
transform volcanic regions for the creation of new mountains
and new chasms. All the elements of his inner
life, assailed by this violence, seemed to dissolve and
multiply at the same time. Images of grandeur and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
terror passed through this tumult, accompanied by
strange harmonies. Swift concentrations and dispersions
of thought succeeded one another, like electric flashes
in a tempest. At certain moments, it seemed to him that
he could hear songs and wild clamors through a doorway
that was opened and closed incessantly; sounds
as if a tempestuous wind bore to his ears the alternate
cries of a massacre and an apotheosis.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with the intensity of a feverish vision, he
saw the scorched and fatal spot of earth whereon he
wished to create the souls of his great tragedy; he felt
all its parching thirst within himself. He saw the mythical
fountain which alone could quench the burning aridity;
and in the bubbling of its springs the purity of
the maiden that must die there. He saw on Perdita's
face the mask of the heroine, quiescent in the beauty
of an extraordinarily calm sorrow. Then the ancient
dryness of the plain of Argos converted itself into flames;
the fountain of Perseia flowed with the swiftness of a
stream. The fire and the water, the two primitive elements,
rushed over all things, effaced all other traces,
spread and wandered, struggled, triumphed, acquired
a word, a language wherewith to unveil their inner essence
and to reveal the innumerable myths born of their
eternity. The symphony expressed the drama of the
two elementary Souls on the stage of the Universe, the
pathetic struggle of two great living and moving Beings,
two cosmic Wills, such as the shepherd Arya fancied it
when he contemplated the spectacle from the high plateau
with his pure eyes. And, of a sudden, from the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
center of the musical mystery, from the depths of the
symphonic Ocean, arose the Ode, brought by the human
voice, and attaining the loftiest heights.</p>

<p>The miracle of Beethoven renewed itself. The winged
Ode, the Hymn, sprang from the midst of the orchestra
to proclaim, in phrases absolute and imperious, the joy
and the sorrow of Man. It was not the Chorus, as in the
Ninth Symphony, but the Voice, alone and dominating,
the interpreter, the messenger to the multitude. "Her
voice! her voice! She has disappeared. Her song
seemed to move the heart of the world, and she was
beyond the veil," said the Animator, who in mental vision
saw again the crystal statue within which he had watched
the mounting wave of melody. "I will seek thee, I shall
find thee again; I will possess myself of thy secret. Thou
shalt sing my hymns, towering at the summit of my
music!" Freed now from all earthly desire, he thought
of that maiden form as the receptacle of a divine gift.
He heard the disembodied voice surge from the depths
of the orchestra to reveal the part of eternal truth that
exists in ephemeral fact. The Ode crowned the episode
with light. Then, as if to lead back to the play of
imagery his ravished spirit from "beyond the veil," a
dancing figure stood out against the rhythm of the dying
Ode. Between the lines of a parallelogram drawn
beneath the arch of the stage, as within the limits of a
strophe, the mute dancer, with her body seemingly free
for a moment from the sad laws of gravity, imitated
the fire, the whirlwind, the revolutions of the stars. "La
Tanagra, flower of Syracuse, made of wings, as a flower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
is made of petals!" Thus he invoked the image of the already
famous Sicilian who had re-discovered the ancient
orchestic art as it had been in the days when Phrynichus
boasted that he had within himself as many figures of
the dance as there were waves on the ocean on a stormy
winter night. The actress, the singer, the dancer&mdash;the
three Dionysian women&mdash;appeared to him like perfect
and almost divine instruments of his creations. With
an incredible rapidity, in word, song, gesture and symphony,
his work should crystallize itself and live an all-powerful
life before the conquered multitude.</p>

<p>He was still silent, lost in an ideal world, waiting to
measure the effort necessary to manifest it. The voices
surrounding him seemed to come from a long distance.</p>

<p>"Wagner declares that the only creator of a work of
art is the people," said Baldassare Stampa, "and that the
sole function of the artist is to gather and express the
creation of the unconscious multitude."</p>

<p>The extraordinary emotion that had stirred Stelio
when, from the throne of the Doges, he had spoken to
the throng seized on him once more. In that communion
between his soul and the soul of the people an almost
divine mystery had existed; something greater and more
exalted was added to the habitual feeling he had for his
own person; he had felt that an unknown power converged
within him, abolishing the limits of his earthly
being and conferring upon his solitary voice the full harmony
of a chorus.</p>

<p>There was, then, in the multitude a secret beauty, in
which only the poet and the hero could kindle a spark.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Whenever that beauty revealed itself by the sudden outburst
from a theater, a public square, or an entrenchment,
a torrent of joy must swell the heart of him who
had known how to inspire it by his verse, his harangue,
or a signal from his sword. Thus, the word of the poet,
when communicated to the people, was an act comparable
to the deed of a hero&mdash;an act that brought to birth
in the great composite soul of the multitude a sudden
comprehension of beauty, as a master sculptor, from the
mere touch of his plastic thumb upon a mass of clay,
creates a divine statue. Then the silence that had spread
like a sacred veil over the completed poem would cease.
The material part of life would no longer be typified by
immaterial symbols: life itself would be manifested in
its perfection by the poet; the word would become flesh,
rhythm would quicken in breathing, palpitating form,
the idea would be embodied with all the fulness of its
force and freedom.</p>

<p>"But," said Fabio Molza, "Richard Wagner believes
that the real heart of the people is composed only of
those that experience grief in common&mdash;you understand,
grief in common."</p>

<p>"Toward Joy&mdash;still toward eternal Joy," Stelio reflected.
"The real heart of the people is composed of
those that feel vaguely the necessity of raising themselves,
by means of Fiction, Poetry, the Ideal, out of
the daily prison in which they serve and suffer."</p>

<p>In his waking dream he beheld the disappearance of
the small theaters of the city, where, amid suffocating
air heavy with impurities, before a crowd of rakes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
courtesans, the actors make public prostitution of their
talents. And then, on the steps of the new theater, his
mental vision beheld the true people, the great, unanimous
multitude, whose human odor he had inhaled,
whose clamor he had listened to in the great marble
shell, under the stars. By the mysterious power of
rhythm, his art, imperfectly understood though it was,
had stirred the rude and ignorant ones with a profound
emotion, penetrating as that felt by a prisoner about to
be released from his chains. Little by little, the sensation
of joy at their deliverance had crept over the most
abject; the deep-lined brows cleared; lips accustomed to
brutal vociferation had parted in amazement; and, above
all, the hands&mdash;the rough hands enslaved by instruments
of toil&mdash;had stretched out in one unanimous gesture of
adoration toward the heroine who in their presence had
wafted toward the stars the spirit of immortal sorrow.</p>

<p>"In the life of a people like ours," said Daniele Glauro,
"a great manifestation of art has much more weight than
a treaty of alliance or a tributary law. That which never
dies is more prized than that which is ephemeral. The
astuteness and audacity of a Malatesta are crystallized
for all time in a medal of Pisanello's. Of Machiavelli's
politics nothing survives but the power of his prose."</p>

<p>"That is true, most true!" thought Stelio; "the fortunes
of Italy are inseparable from the fate of the Beauty
of which she is the Mother." This sovereign truth now
appeared to him the rising sun of that divine, ideal land
through which wandered the great Dante. "Italy!
Italy!" Throughout his being, like a call to arms, seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to thrill that name, that name which intoxicates the
world. From its ruins, bathed in so much heroic blood,
should not the new art, robust in root and branch, arise
and flourish? Should it not become a determining and
constructive force in the third Rome, reawakening all
the latent power possessed by the hereditary substance
of the nation, indicating to her statesmen the primitive
truths that are the necessary bases of new institutions?
Faithful to the oldest instincts of his race, Richard
Wagner had foreseen, and had fostered by his own efforts,
the aspiration of the German States to the heroic
grandeur of the Empire. He had evoked the noble figure
of Henry the Fowler, standing erect beneath the ancient
oak: "Let warriors arise from every German land!"
And at Sadowa and at Sedan these warriors had won.
With the same impulse, the same tenacity, people and
artist had achieved their glorious aim. The same degree
of victory had crowned the work of the sword and
the work of melody. Like the hero, the poet had accomplished
an act of deliverance. Like the will of the
Iron Chancelor, like the blood of his soldiers, the Master's
musical numbers had contributed toward the exalting and
perpetuating of the soul of his race.</p>

<p>"He has been here only a few days, at the Palazzo
Vendramin-Calergi," said Prince Hoditz.</p>

<p>And suddenly the image of the barbaric creator seemed
to Stelio to approach him; the lines of his face became
visible, the blue eyes gleamed under the wide brow, the
lips closed tight above the powerful chin, armed with
sensuousness, pride, and disdain. The slight body, bent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with the weight of age and glory, straightened itself,
appeared almost as gigantic as his work, took on the
aspect of a god. The blood coursed like a swift mountain
torrent, its breath sighed like a forest breeze. Suddenly
the youth of Siegfried filled the figure and permeated
it, radiant as the dawn shining through a cloud.
"To follow the impulse of my heart, to obey my instinct,
to listen to the voice of Nature within myself&mdash;that is
my supreme law!" The heroic, resounding words, springing
from the depths, expressed the young and healthy
will that had triumphed over all obstacles and all evil,
always in accord with the law of the Universe. And
the flames, called forth from the rock by the wand of
Wotan, arose in the magic circle: "On the flaming sea
a way has opened! To plunge into that fire, oh, ineffable
joy! To find my bride within that flaming circle!"
All the phantoms of the myth seemed to blaze anew
and then vanish.</p>

<p>Then the winged helmet of Brunehilde gleamed in the
sunlight: "Glory to the sun! Glory to the light! Glory
to the radiant day! My sleep was long. Who has awakened
me?" The phantoms fled in tumult, and dispersed.
Then arose from the dark shadows the maiden of the
song, Donatella Arvale, as she had appeared to him
amid the purple and gold of the immense hall in a commanding
attitude and holding a fiery flower in her hand:
"Dost thou not see me, then? Do not my burning gaze
and ardent blood make thee tremble. Dost thou not
feel this wild ardor?" Though she was absent, she
seemed to resume her power over his dream. Infinite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
music seemed to rise from the silent, empty place in the
supper-room. Her Hermes-like face seemed to retain
an inviolable secret: "Do not touch me; do not trouble
my repose, and I will reflect forever thy luminous image.
Love only thyself and renounce all thought of me!" And
again, as on the feverish water, a passionate impatience
tortured the Animator, and again he fancied the absent
one like a beautiful bow to be drawn by a strong hand
that would know how to use it as an instrument to
achieve some great conquest: "Awake, virgin, awake!
Live and laugh! Be mine!"</p>

<p>Stelio's spirit was drawn violently into the orbit of
the magic world created by the German god; its visions
and harmonies overwhelmed him; the figures of the
Northern myth towered above those of his own art and
passion, obscuring them. His own desire and his own
hope spoke the language of the barbarian: "I must love
thee, blindly, and laughing: and, laughing, we must unite
and lose ourselves, each in the other. O radiant Love!
O smiling Death!" The joyousness of the warrior-virgin
on the flame-circled summit reached the loftiest height;
her cry of love and liberty mounted to the heart of the
sun. Ah, what heights and what depths had he not
touched, that formidable Master of human souls! What
effort could ever equal his? What eagle could ever hope
to soar higher? His gigantic work was there, finished,
amidst men. Throughout the world swelled the last
mighty chorus of the Grail, the canticle of thanksgiving:
"Glory to the Miracle! Redemption to the Redeemer!"</p>

<p>"He is tired," said Prince Hoditz, "very tired and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
feeble. That is the reason why we did not see him at
the Doge's Palace. His heart is affected." ...</p>

<p>Once more the giant became a man: the slight body,
bent with age and glory, consumed by passion, slowly
dying. And Stelio heard again in his heart Perdita's
words, which had called up the image of another stricken
artist&mdash;the father of Donatella Arvale. "The name of
the bow is BIOS ("life"), and its work is death!"</p>

<p>The young man saw his pathway blazed before him
by victory&mdash;the long art, the short life. "Forward, still
forward! Higher, ever higher!" Every hour, every
second, he must strive, struggle, fortify himself against
destruction, diminution, oppression, contagion. Every
hour, every second, his eye must be fixed on his aim, concentrating
and directing all his energies, without truce,
without relaxation. He felt that victory was as necessary
to his soul as air to his lungs. At the contact with
the German barbarian, a furious thirst for conflict awoke
in his Latin blood. "To you now belongs the will to
do!" Wagner had declared, on the day of the opening
of the new theater: "In the work of art of the future,
the source of invention will never run dry." Art was
infinite, like the beauty of the world. There are no
limits to courage or to power. Man must seek and find,
further and still further. "Forward, still forward!"</p>

<p>Then a single wave, vast and shapeless, embodying all
the aspirations and all the agitations of that delirium,
whirling itself into a maelstrom, seemed to take on the
qualities of plastic matter, obeying the same inexhaustible
energy that forms all animals and all things under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the sun. An extraordinary image, beautiful and pure,
was born of this travail, lived and glowed with unbearable
intensity. The poet saw it, absorbed it with a pure
gaze, felt that it took root in the very depths of his being.
"Ah, to express it, to manifest it to the world, to
fix it in perfection for all eternity!" Sublime moment
that never would return! All visions vanished. Around
him flowed the current of daily life; fleeting words
sounded; expectation palpitated, desire still lived.</p>

<p>He looked at the woman. The stars sparkled; the
trees waved, and the dark garden spread out behind Perdita,
and her eyes still said: "Let me serve! Let me
serve!"</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
THE PROMISE</h2>


<p>Descending the terrace to the garden, the guests
had dispersed among the shady paths and under
the vine-covered trellises. The night breeze
was damp and warm, touching the long lashes
on delicate eyelids like lips brushing them in a caress.
The invisible stars of the jasmine perfumed the darkness;
the rich fragrance of fruit, too, was even stronger
than in the island gardens. A vivid power of fertility
emanated from this narrow trace of cultivated earth,
which appeared like a place of exile, surrounded by a
girdle of water, and, like an exiled soul, all the more
intense.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to remain here? Shall I return after
the others have gone? Say quickly! It is late!"</p>

<p>"No, no, Stelio, I beg of you! It is late&mdash;it is too late!
You yourself say it is."</p>

<p>La Fosacarina's voice was full of mortal terror. Her
white arms and shoulders trembled in the shadows. She
wished at once to refuse and to yield; she wished to
die, yet she wished to feel his strong embrace. She
trembled more and more; her teeth chattered slightly,
for a glacial stream seemed to submerge her, chilling her
from head to foot. The strange emotion caused a fancy
that her very limbs were ready to break, and she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
conscious that the stiffness of her set features had even
changed the sound of her voice. And still she longed
at once to die and to be loved; still, over her terror, her
chill, her body no longer young, hung the terrible sentence
the beloved had pronounced, which she herself had
repeated: "It is late&mdash;it is too late!"</p>

<p>"Your promise, your promise, Perdita! I will not be
put off!"</p>

<p>The tide, swelling like a full, fair throat, the estuary,
lost in darkness and death, the City, when illumined
by the twilight fire, the water flowing in the invisible
clepsydra, the bronze bells with their vibrations reaching
to the sky, the eager wish, the contracted lips, lowered
eyelids, feverish hands, all recurred with the memory
of the silent promise. With wild ardor he longed
to clasp that being, whose knowledge of all things was
immeasurably deep and rich.</p>

<p>"No, I will not be put off!"</p>

<p>His ardor had come to him from far-distant ages, from
the most ancient origins, the primitive simplicity of
sudden unions, the antique mystery of sacred furies.
Like the horde that was possessed by the enchantment
of the gods, and descended the mountain side, tearing up
trees, rushing on with blind fury, momentarily increasing,
its numbers swelled by other madmen, spreading
madness in its way, and finally becoming one vast bestial
yet human multitude, impelled by a monstrous will, so
the crudest of instincts urged him on, confusing all his
ideas in a dizzy whirl. And what most attracted him
in that wandering and despairing woman, whose knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was deep and rich, was the consciousness that she
was a being oppressed by the eternal servitude of her
nature, destined to succumb to the sudden convulsions
of her sex; a being who soothed the fever of stage life
in sensuous repose, the fiery actress, who passed from
the frenzied plaudits of the multitude to the embrace of
a lover; the Dionysian creature who chose to crown her
mysterious rites as they were crowned in the ancient
orgies.</p>

<p>His amorous madness was now immeasurable, and was
a mingling of cruelty, jealousy, poetry and pride. He
regretted that he never had sought her after some dramatic
triumph, warm from the breath of the people,
breathless and disheveled, showing the traces of the tragic
soul that had wept and cried in her, with the tears
of that alien spirit still damp on her agitated face. As
by a flash of light, he had a sudden vision of her reclining,
at rest, yet full of the power that had drawn forth
a howl from the monster, panting like a Mænad after the
dance, athirst and weary.</p>

<p>"Ah, do not be cruel!" entreated the woman, who
felt in the voice of the beloved, and read in his eyes,
the madness that possessed him. From the burning gaze
of the young man she shrank with pathetic modesty.
His insistence hurt the sensitive delicacy of her spirit.
She recognized in it all that there was of mere selfish
impulse; she well knew that he thought of her as something
poisonous and corrupt, with memories of many
loves, a wandering, implacable temptress. She divined
the sudden grudgingness, jealousy and feverish resentment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that had blazed up in the long-beloved friend, to
whom she had consecrated all of herself that was most
precious and most sincere, preserving the perfection of
that sentiment by her steadfast refusal to break down
all barriers. Now, all was lost; all was suddenly devastated,
like a fair domain at the mercy of rebellious
and vindictive slaves. Then, almost as if she were passing
through the last agonies of death, her whole bitter
and stormy past rose before her: that life of struggle and
pain, bewilderment, effort, passion, and triumph. She
felt all its heavy burden weighing on her, and recalled
the ineffable joy, the feeling of mingled terror and
freedom, with which, in her far-distant youth, she had
given her first, fresh love to the man who had deceived
her. And through her mind passed the image of herself,
that maiden who had disappeared, who perhaps was
still dreaming in some solitary place, or weeping, or
promising herself future happiness. "Too late&mdash;it is
too late!" The irrevocable word rang continually in
her ears like the reverberation of the bronze bells.</p>

<p>"Do not be cruel, Stelio!" she repeated, white and
delicate as the swansdown that encircled her shoulders.
She seemed suddenly to have shorn herself of her power,
to have become slight and weak, to have assumed a
secret, tender personality, easy to kill, to destroy, to immolate
as a bloodless sacrifice.</p>

<p>"No, Perdita, I will not be cruel," he stammered, suddenly
discomposed by her face and voice, his heart stirred
with human pity, arising from the same depths that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
had harbored his wilder instincts. "Pardon me! Forgive!"</p>

<p>He would have liked to take her in his arms that moment,
to nurse her, console her, let her weep on his breast,
and to dry her tears. He felt that he no longer recognized
her, that some unknown creature stood before
him, infinitely humble and sad, deprived of all strength.
His pity and remorse were like the emotion we feel if
we unwillingly hurt or offend an invalid or a child&mdash;some
lonely and inoffensive little being.</p>

<p>"Pardon me!"</p>

<p>He would have liked to kneel, to kiss her feet in the
grass, to murmur little fond phrases in her ear. He
bent toward her and touched her hand. She started
violently, opened wide her large eyes upon him; then
lowered her eyelids and stood motionless. Shadows
seemed to gather under her arched brows, throwing into
relief the curve of her cheeks. Again the glacial wave
submerged her.</p>

<p>Voices arose from the guests dispersed about the
garden, then a long silence followed.</p>

<p>Presently a crunching of gravel, as if trodden by a
heavy foot, was heard, followed by another long silence.
Soon a confused clamor was heard coming from the
canals; the jasmine's fragrance was heavier than before,
as a heart in suspense quickens in movement. The night
seemed fraught with miracles, and eternal forces worked
harmoniously between the earth and the stars.</p>

<p>"Pardon me! If my love oppresses you, I will continue
to stifle it; I will even renounce it forever, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
obey you. Perdita! Perdita! I will forget all that your
eyes said to me a little while ago, in the midst of the idle
talk. What embrace, what caress could more wholly
unite our souls? All the passion of the night threw us
together. I received your soul like a wave. And now
it seems that never again can I separate my heart from
yours, nor can you separate yours from mine. Together
we must go forward to meet I know not what mysterious
dawn...."</p>

<p>He spoke in a low tone, with absolute abandon, having
become for the moment a vibrating substance that
responded to every change in the nocturnal spirit that
bewitched him. That which he saw before him was no
longer a corporeal form, an impenetrable prison of flesh;
it was a soul unveiled by a succession of appearances
not less expressive than melody itself, an infinite sensibility,
delicate and powerful, which, in that slight frame,
created in turn the fragility of the flower, the vigor of
marble, the flash of the flame, all shadows and all light.</p>

<p>"Stelio!"</p>

<p>She hardly breathed that name aloud; yet in the sigh
that died on her soft lips was as thrilling a note of
wonder and exultation as would have been revealed in
the most piercing cry. In the accent of the man she had
recognized love: love, real love! She, who had so often
listened to beautiful and perfect words pronounced by
that clear voice, and who had suffered under them as
from a torture or a heartless jest, now saw her own life
and all the world suddenly transformed at this new accent.
Her very soul seemed changed; that which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
encumbered it fell away into dim, far-off obscurity, while
to the surface rose something free and immaculate, that
dilated and curved over her like the sky; and, as the wave
of light mounts from the horizon to the zenith with mute
harmony, the illusion of happiness mounted to her lips.
A smile softly spread over her lips, which quivered like
leaves in the breeze, showing a glimpse as pearly as the
jasmine's starry flowers.</p>

<p>"All is abolished&mdash;all is vanished. I never have lived,
I never have loved, I never have suffered. I am renewed.
I never have known any love but this. My heart is
pure. I should wish to die in the joy of your love.
Years and experience have passed over me without reaching
that part of my soul which I have kept for you, that
secret heaven which has suddenly opened to the unforeseen,
has triumphed over all my sadness, and has remained
alone to cherish the strength and the sweetness
of your name. Your love will save me; the fulness of my
love will render you divine!"</p>

<p>Words of wildest transport sprang from her liberated
heart, though her lips dared not speak them. But she
smiled&mdash;smiled her infinite, mysterious, silent smile!</p>

<p>"Is it not true? Speak&mdash;answer me, Perdita! Do you
not feel too our need of each other&mdash;all the stronger
from our long renunciation, from the patience with which
we have awaited this hour? Ah, it seems to me that
all my presentiments and all my hopes would count as
nothing, if it were fated that this hour should not come to
pass. Say that without me you could not have waited,
after life's darkness, for the glorious dawn, as I could
not wait without you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!"</p>

<p>In that stifled syllable, she was lost irrevocably. The
smile faded, the lines of the mouth became heavy, causing
it to appear in sharply drawn relief against the pallor
of her face; the lips seemed athirst, strong to attract,
to cling, insatiable. And her whole body, which just before
had seemed to shrink in sensitiveness and apprehension,
now drew itself up again, as if formed anew,
recovering all its physical power, and inundated by an
impetuous wave of emotion.</p>

<p>"Let us have no more uncertainty. It is late."</p>

<p>He could not disguise his impatience of the social restraints
that must be observed on account of the other
guests.</p>

<p>"Yes!" La Foscarina repeated, but in a new accent,
her eyes dwelling upon his, commanding, imperious, as
if she felt certain now of possessing a philter that should
bind him to her forever.</p>

<p>Stelio felt his heart-throbs quicken still more at the
thought of the love this mysterious being must be able
to give. He gazed deep into her eyes, and saw that she
was as pale as if all her blood had been sapped by the
earth to nourish the rich fruits of the garden; and it
seemed to him that the present was part of a dream-life,
wherein he and she lived alone in all the world.</p>

</div>

<p>La Foscarina was standing under a shrub laden with
fruit. The sudden beauty that had illumined her in the
supper-room, made up of a thousand ideal forces, reappeared
in her face with still greater intensity, kindled
now from the flame that never dies, the fervor that never
languishes. The magnificent fruits hung over her head,
bearing the crown of a royal donor. The myth of the
pomegranate was revivified in the mystery of midnight,
as it had been at the passing of the boat in the mystic
twilight. Who was this woman? Was she Persephone
herself, Queen of Shades? Had she dwelt in that unknown
region where all human agitations seem as trifling
as idle winds on a dusty, interminable road? Had she
contemplated the springs of the world, sunk deep in the
earth? Had she counted the roots of the flowers, immobile
as the veins in a petrified body? Was she weary
or intoxicated with human tears, laughter, and sensuousness,
and with having touched, one after another, all
things mortal, to make them bloom only to see them
perish? Who was she? Had she struck upon cities like
a scourge, silenced forever with her kiss all lips that
sang, stopped the pulsation of tyrannous hearts? Who
was she&mdash;who? What secret past made her so pale, so
passionate, so perilous? Had she already divulged all
her secrets and given all her gifts, or could she still, by
new arts, enchant her new lover, for whom life, love, and
victory were one and the same thing? All this, and
more, was suggested to him by the little veins in her
temples, the curve of her cheeks, the lithe strength of
her body.</p>

<p>"All evil, all good, that which I know and do not
know, that which you know, as well as that which you
are ignorant of&mdash;all this had to be, to prepare the fulness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of this night." Life and the dream had become one.
Thought and sense were as wines poured into the same
cup. Even their garments, their faces, their hopes, their
glances, were like the plants of the garden, like the air,
the stars, the silence.</p>

<p>Sublime moment, never to return! Before he realized it,
his hands involuntarily reached out to draw her to himself.
The woman's head fell backward, as if she were
about to faint; between her half-closed eyelids and her
parted lips her eyes and her teeth gleamed as things
gleam for the last time. Then swiftly she raised her
head again and recovered herself; her lips sought the
lips that sought hers.</p>

<p>After a moment they saw each other again in a lucid
way. The voices of the guests in the garden were wafted
to their ears, and an indistinct clamor from the far-off
canal rose from time to time.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded the young man feverishly, after
that burning kiss of body and soul.</p>

<p>The lady bent to lift a fallen pomegranate from the
grass. The fruit was ripe; it had burst open in its fall
and now poured out its blood from the wound it had received.
With the vision of the fruit-laden boat, the pale
islet, and the field of asphodels, to the impassioned
woman's mind returned the words of the Inspirer: "This
is my body.... Take, eat!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>With a mechanical movement she crushed the fruit
in her hand, as if she wished to expel all its juice, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
trickled in a stream over her wrist. She trembled, as the
glacial wave rushed over her anew.</p>

<p>"Go away when the others go, but then&mdash;return! I
will wait for you at the gate of the Gradenigo garden."</p>

<p>She trembled still, partly from terror, a prey to an invincible
power. As by a flash of light, again he saw
her reclining, at rest, panting like a Mænad after the
dance. They gazed at each other, but could not bear the
fierce light of each other's eyes. They parted.</p>

<p>She went in the direction of the voices of the poets
who had exalted her ideal power.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
"TO CREATE WITH JOY!"</h2>


<p>Lost! Lost! Now she was lost! She still lived&mdash;vanquished,
humiliated, as if some one had
trampled pitilessly upon her; she still lived, and
dawn was breaking, the days were beginning
again, the fresh tide was flowing once more into the
City Beautiful, and Donatella was still sleeping upon her
pure pillow. Into an infinite distance had faded the hour,
in reality so short a time before, when she had waited
at the gate for her beloved, recognized his step in the
funereal silence of the deserted path, and felt her knees
weaken as if from a blow, while a strange reverberation
rang in her ears. How far-away now seemed that hour!
yet the little incidents of her vigil returned to her mind
with intensity: the cold iron rail against which she had
leaned her head, the sharp, acrid odor that rose from
the grass as from a retting-vat, the moist tongue of Lady
Myrta's greyhounds that came noiselessly and licked her
hands.</p>

<p>"Good-by! Good-by!"</p>

<p>She was lost! He had left her as he would have left
some light love, almost with the manner of a stranger,
almost impatient even, drawn by the freshness of the
dawn, by the freedom of the morning.</p>

<p>"Good-by!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>From her window she perceived Stelio on the bank
of the canal; he was inhaling deep breaths of the fresh
morning air; then in the perfect calm that reigned over
all things, she heard his clear, confident voice calling
the gondolier:</p>

<p>"Zorzi!"</p>

<p>The man was asleep in the bottom of his gondola, and
his human slumber resembled that of the curved boat
that obeyed his movements. Stelio touched him lightly
with his foot, and instantly he sprang up, jumped to
his place and seized the oar. Man and boat awoke at the
same time, as if they had but one body, ready to glide
over the water.</p>

<p>"Your servant, Signor!" said Zorzi with a smile, glancing
up at the brightening sky. "Sit down, Signor, and I
will row."</p>

<p>Opposite the palace, the door of a large workshop was
thrown open. It was a stonecutter's shop, where steps
were fashioned from the stone of Val-di-Sole.</p>

<p>"To ascend!" thought Stelio, and his superstitious soul
rejoiced at the good omen. On the sign, the name of the
quarry seemed radiant with promise&mdash;the Valley of the
Sun. He had already seen, a short time before, the image
of a stairway, on a coat-of-arms in the Gradenigo garden&mdash;a
symbol of his own ascension. "Higher, always
higher!" Joy came bubbling up from the depths of his
being. The morning awakened all manly energies.</p>

<p>"And Perdita? And Ariadne?" He saw them again,
as they descended the marble stairway, in the light of
the smoking torches. "And La Tanagra?" The Syracusan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
appeared to his vision, with her long, goat-like
eyes, reposing gracefully upon her mother earth, motionless
as a bas-relief on the marble in which it is carved.
"The Dionysian Trinity!" He fancied them as exempt
from all passion, immune from all evil, like creations
of art. The surface of his soul seemed covered with
swift and splendid images, like sails scattered over a
swelling sea. His heart beat calmly, and with the approaching
sunrise he felt a renewal of his life-forces, as
if he were born anew with the morning.</p>

<p>"We do not need this light any longer," murmured
the gondolier slyly, extinguishing the lantern of the gondola.</p>

<p>"To the Grand Canal, by San Giovanni Decollato!"
cried Stelio, seating himself.</p>

<p>As the dentellated prow swung into the Canal of San
Giacomo dall'Orio, he turned to look once more at the
palace, of a leaden hue in the early dawn. One lighted
window grew dark at that moment, like an eye suddenly
blinded. "Good-by! Good-by!" The woman no
longer young was up there alone, sad with the sadness
of death; the Song-Maiden was preparing to return to
the place of her long sacrifice. He knew not how to
pity, he could only promise. From the abundance of his
strength, he drew an illusion that he might change those
two destinies for his own joy.</p>

<p>"Stop before the Palazzo Vendramin-Calergi!" he ordered
the gondolier.</p>

<p>The canal, ancient stream of silence and of poetry, was
deserted. The pale green sky was reflected in it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
its last fading stars. At first glance, the palace had an
aerial appearance, like an artificial cloud hung over the
water. The shadows in which it was still wrapped suggested
the quality of velvet, the beauty of something
soft and magnificent. And, just as in studying a deep-piled
velvet, the pattern gradually becomes discernible,
the architectural lines revealed themselves in the three
Corinthian columns that rose with rhythmic grace
and strength to the point where the emblems of nobility,
the eagles, the horses, and the amphora, were mingled
with the roses of Loredan. NON NOBIS, DOMINE,
NON NOBIS.</p>

<p>Within that palace throbbed the great ailing heart.
Stelio saw again the image of the barbaric creator: the
blue eyes gleaming under the broad brow, the lips compressed
above the powerful chin, armed with sensuousness,
pride, and disdain. Was he sleeping? Could he
sleep, or was he lying sleepless with his glory? The
young man recalled strange things that were told of
Wagner. Was it true that he could not sleep unless his
head rested on his wife's bosom, and that, despite advancing
years, he clung to her as a lover to his mistress?
He remembered a story told him by Lady Myrta, who,
while she was in Palermo, had visited the Villa d'Angri,
where the very closets in the room occupied by the
master had remained impregnated with an essence of
rose so strong that it made her ill. He fancied that slight,
tired body, wrapped in sumptuous draperies, ornamented
with jewels, perfumed like a corpse ready for the pyre.
Was it not Venice that had given him, as long ago it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
had given Albert Dürer, a taste for luxury and magnificence?
Yes, and it was in the silence of her canals
that he had heard the passing of the most ardent breath
of all his music&mdash;the deadly passion of Tristan and Isolde.</p>

<p>And now, within that palace throbbed the great ailing
heart, and there its formidable impetuosity was flagging.
The patrician palace, with its eagles, its horses,
amphora, and roses, was as tightly closed and silent as
a great tomb. Above its marble towers the sunrise
turned the pale green sky to rosy pink.</p>

<p>"Hail to the Victorious One!" Stelio stood up and
cast his flowers at the threshold of the palace door.</p>

<p>"On! On!" he cried.</p>

<p>Urged by this sudden impatience, the gondolier bent to
his oar, and the light craft threaded its way along the
stream. A brown sail passed silently. The sea, the
rippling waves, the laughing cry of the sea-gulls, the
sweeping breeze arose before his desire.</p>

<p>"Row, Zorzi, row! To the Veneta Marina, by the
Canal dall'Olio!" the young man cried.</p>

<p>The canal seemed too narrow for the expanse of his
soul. Victory was now as necessary to his spirit as air
to his lungs. After the delirium of the night, he wished
to prove the perfection of his physical nature by the
light of day and in the sharp breeze of the sea. He did
not wish to sleep. He felt a circle of freshness around
his eyes, as if he had bathed them with dew. He had
no desire for repose, and the thought of his bed in the
hotel filled him with disgust. "The deck of a ship, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
odor of pitch and of salt, the flutter of a red sail....
Row, Zorzi!"</p>

<p>The gondolier redoubled his efforts. The Fondaco dei
Turchi disappeared from their view, a vision of marvelously
yellow old ivory, like the only remaining portico
of some ruined mosque. They passed the Palazzo of the
Cornaro and the Palazzo of the Pesaro, those two giants
blackened by time as by smoke from a fire; they passed
the Ca' d'Oro, a divine marvel of air and stone; and suddenly
the Rialto bridge showed its ample back, laden
with shops, already bustling with life, sending forth the
odor of vegetables and fish, like a great horn of plenty
pouring out upon the shores the fruits of earth and sea
to feed the Queen of Cities.</p>

<p>"I am hungry, Zorzi, I am very hungry!" said Stelio,
laughing.</p>

<p>"A good sign when a wakeful night makes one hungry;
it makes only the old feel sleepy," said Zorzi.</p>

<p>"Row to shore!"</p>

<p>He bought at a stall some grapes of the Vignole and
some figs from Malamocco, laid on a plate of vine-leaves.</p>

<p>"Row, Zorzi!"</p>

<p>The gondola turned, then sped under the Fondaco dei
Tedeschi, making its way toward the Rio de Palazzo.
The bells were now ringing joyously in the full daylight,
drowning the noises of the market-place with their brazen
tongues.</p>

<p>"To the Ponte della Paglia!"</p>

<p>A thought, spontaneous as an instinct, led him back
to the glorious spot where it seemed some trace must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
remain of his lyric inspiration and of the great Dionysian
chorus: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viva il forte!</i> The gondola grazed the side of
the Palace of the Doge, massive as a monolith cut by
chisels not less apt in finding melodies than the bows of
the musicians. With all his new-born soul he embraced
the mass; he heard once more the sound of his own
voice and the bursts of applause. He said again to himself:
"To create with joy! That is an attribute of Divinity!
Impossible to imagine, in the highest flight of the
spirit, a more triumphal act. Even the phrase itself has
something of the splendor of the dawn."</p>

<p>Again and again he repeated to the air, the waters,
the stones, to the ancient city, to the young dawn: "To
create with joy! To create with joy!"</p>

<p>When the prow passed under the bridge and entered
the mirror of light, a freer breath gave him fresh realization,
with his hope and his courage, of the beauty and
strength of the life of the past.</p>

<p>"Find me a boat, Zorzi&mdash;a boat that will go out to sea."</p>

<p>He longed for still wider space in which to breathe;
he longed to feel a strong wind, salt air and dashing
spray; to see the sails swell, and the bowsprit pointed
toward a boundless horizon.</p>

<p>"To the Veneta Marina! Find me a fishing-boat, a
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bragozzo</i> from Chioggia."</p>

<p>He perceived a large red and black sail, just hoisted,
and now flapping in the breeze, superb as an ancient
banner of the Republic, with the device of the Lion and
the Book.</p>

<p>"That one there&mdash;that will do. Let us catch it, Zorzi."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>In his impatience he waved his hand, to sign to the
boat to stop.</p>

<p>"Call out to them to wait for me, Zorzi!"</p>

<p>The gondolier, heated and dripping, cried out to the
man at the sail. The gondola flew like a canoe in a
regatta.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Zorzi!"</p>

<p>But Stelio was panting, too, as if he were in pursuit
of fortune, some happy aim, or the certainty of a kingdom.</p>

<p>"We have won the flag!" laughed the gondolier, rubbing
his burning palms. "What foolishness!"</p>

<p>The movement, the tone, the good-humor, the astonished
faces of the fishermen leaning over the rail, the
reflection of the red sail in the water, the cordial odor
of fresh bread from a neighboring bake-shop, the smell
of boiling pitch from a dock-yard, the voices of workmen
entering the arsenal, the strong emanations from
the quays, impregnated with the odor of the old rotten
vessels of the Serene Republic, the resounding blows of
the hammer on the vessels of the new Italy&mdash;all these
rude and healthful things aroused a wonderful joyousness
in the heart of the young man, who laughed aloud
for very gladness.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" demanded the older of the fishermen,
bending toward the ringing laughter his bearded
bronzed face. "What can I do for you, Signor?"</p>

<p>The mast creaked as if it were alive, swaying from
top to bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can come on board, if you like," he said. "Is
that all you want?"</p>

<p>He brought a ladder and attached it to the stern. It
was a simple affair of ropes and pegs, but to Stelio it
seemed, like all else in the rough craft, to have a life
of its own. As he stepped upon it he felt almost ashamed
of his light, glossy shoes. The heavy, calloused hand
of the sailor, covered with blue tattoo-marks, helped him
to climb up and pulled him on board with a jerk.</p>

<p>"The grapes and the figs, Zorzi!"</p>

<p>From the gondola, Zorzi handed him the vine-leaf plate.</p>

<p>"May it make new blood for you, Signor!"</p>

<p>"And the bread?"</p>

<p>"We have some warm bread," said one of the sailors,
"just out of the oven."</p>

<p>Hunger would certainly give that bread a delicious
flavor, finding therein all the nourishment of the grain.</p>

<p>"Your servant, Signor, and a fair wind to you!" said
the gondolier, taking leave.</p>

<p>"Starboard!"</p>

<p>The lateen sail, with the Lion and the Book, swelled
crimson. The craft turned toward the open sea, directing
its course toward San Servolo. The shore seemed
to assume a sharp curve, as if to repel it.</p>

<p>"To the right!"</p>

<p>The boat veered with great force. A miracle met it:
the first rays of the sun pierced the fluttering sail and
illumined the angels on the campaniles of San Marco
and San Giorgio Maggiore, setting on fire the globe of
the Fortuna and crowning the five miters of the Basilica
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
with a diadem of light. Venice Anadyomene reigned
over the waters, and from her beauty all her veils were
ravished.</p>

<p>"Glory to the Miracle!" An almost superhuman feeling
of power and of freedom swelled the young man's
heart as the wind had swollen the sail transfigured for
him. In its crimson splendor, he saw himself as in the
splendor of his own blood. It seemed to him that all
the mystery of this beauty demanded of him a triumphal
act. He felt confident that he was able to accomplish it.
"To create with joy!"</p>

<p>And the world was his!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
"IN TIME!"</h2>


<p>"In time!" In a room of the Academy, La
Foscarina had stopped before <cite>La Vecchia</cite>, by
Francesco Torbido&mdash;that wrinkled, toothless,
flaccid, yellow old woman, who could no
longer either smile or weep, that human ruin worse than
decay, that species of earthly Parca, who, instead of
spindle, thread, or scissors, held in her hand a card
bearing that significant warning.</p>

<p>"In time!" she said again, when she and her companion
were once more in the open air. She said it to
break the pensive silence, during which she had felt her
heart sink, like a stone cast into dark waters. She spoke
again suddenly:</p>

<p>"Stelio, do you know that closed house in the Calle
Gambara?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;which house?"</p>

<p>"The house of the Countess of Glanegg."</p>

<p>"No, I don't know it."</p>

<p>"Do you not know the story of the beautiful Austrian?"</p>

<p>"No, Fosca. Tell it to me."</p>

<p>"Will you go with me as far as the Calle Gambara;
it is only a short distance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will go."</p>

<p>They walked along, side by side, toward the closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
mansion. Stelio fell back a step, that he might observe
the actress, that he might behold her grace as she walked
in that warm, dead air. With his ardent gaze he seemed
to embrace her whole person: the line of her shoulders
sloping with noble grace, the free and pliant waist on the
strong hips, the knees that moved lightly among the folds
of her robe, and that pale, passionate face, those eloquent
lips, that brow, lofty and beautiful as that of a man, the
fringe of dark lashes over the elongated eyes, that sometimes
were clouded over, as if tears rose to them and
remained unshed&mdash;the whole passionate face full of lights
and shadows, love and sadness, feverish force and quivering
life.</p>

<p>"I love you! I love you! You alone please me! Everything
about you pleases me!" he said to her suddenly,
whispering the words close to her cheek. He was now
walking so close as almost to press against her, as he
accommodated his step to hers, his arm passed under
her arm. He could not bear to know that she was seized
with startled anguish at those terrible warning words.</p>

<p>She trembled, stopped; her eyelids drooped, her cheeks
turned pale.</p>

<p>"My friend!" she said, in a tone so faint that the two
words seemed modulated less by her lips than by the
rare smile of her spirit.</p>

<p>Her sudden sadness melted away, changed into a wave
of tenderness that poured in a lavish flood over her
friend. Her unbounded gratitude inspired her with an
eager desire to find some great gift for him.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Stelio, what can I do for thee?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>She imagined some marvelous test, some unheard-of
proof of love. "Let me serve! Let me serve!" cried her
heart. She yearned to own the whole earth, that she
might offer it to him.</p>

<p>"What dost thou wish? Tell me&mdash;what can I do for
thee?"</p>

<p>"Love me&mdash;only love me!"</p>

<p>"Poor friend, my love is sad."</p>

<p>"It is perfect; it crowns my life."</p>

<p>"But you are young."</p>

<p>"I love you!"</p>

<p>"You should possess one with strength equal to your
own."</p>

<p>"But it is you, and only you, that each day increases
my strength and exalts my hope. My blood runs quicker
when I am near you in your mystic silence. At those
times things are born in my brain that in time you will
marvel to see. You are necessary to me."</p>

<p>"Do not say that!"</p>

<p>"Each day you confirm me in the assurance that all
promises made to me will be kept."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will have your own beautiful destiny. For
you I have no fear; you are sure of yourself. No peril
can surprise you, no obstacle can impede your progress.
Oh, to be able to love without fear! One always fears
when one loves. It is not for you that I fear. You seem
to me invincible. I thank you for that also."</p>

<p>She showed him her faith, deep as her passion, lucid
and unlimited. For a long time, even in the heat of
her own struggles and the vicissitudes of her wandering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
life, she had kept her eyes fixed on this young, victorious
existence, as on an ideal form born of the purification
of her own desire. More than once, in the sadness of
vain loves and the nobility of the prohibition imposed
between them, she had thought: "Ah, if, some day, from
all my courage, hardened in many storms, from all the
strong, clear things that grief and revolt have revealed
in the depths of my soul, from the best of myself, I
could fashion for thee the wings that shall bear thee upward
in thy last supreme flight!" More than once, her
melancholy had been dissipated in a heroic presentiment.
And then she had subjected her soul to restraint, had
raised it to the highest plane of moral beauty that she
could, had guided it in paths of purity, solely to merit
that for which she hoped and feared at once&mdash;to be
worthy of offering her servitude to him who was so impatient
to conquer the world.</p>

<p>And now a sudden violent shock of Fate had thrown
her before him in the guise of a mere weak woman, overcome
by earthly passion. She had united herself to him
by the closest tie; she had watched him at dawn, sleeping;
she had had sudden awakenings, alarmed by cruel
fear, and had found it impossible to close her tired eyes
again, lest he should gaze on her while she slept, and
see in her face the lines of care and years.</p>

<p>"Nothing is worth the inspiration you give me," said
Stelio, pressing her arm close and seeking her soft wrist
under her glove, urged by a longing to feel the pulsation
of that devoted life. "Nothing is worth the assurance
that nevermore until death shall I be alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, you too feel that, do you&mdash;that it is forever?"
she cried in a transport of joy at seeing the triumph of
her love. "Yes, forever, Stelio&mdash;whatever happens,
wherever your destiny may lead you, in whatever way
you wish me to serve you, either near you or afar...."</p>

<p>In the misty air rose a confused and monotonous sound,
which La Foscarina recognized as the chorus of sparrows
gathered among the dying trees in the garden of
the Countess of Glanegg. The words died on her lips;
she made an instinctive movement as if to turn back and
to draw her companion with her.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" Stelio asked, surprised at her
sudden movement, and at the unforeseen interruption,
that came like a burst of magic music.</p>

<p>She stopped, smiling her faint smile that showed her
heart was aching. ("IN TIME!")</p>

<p>"I wished to escape," she replied, "but I cannot."</p>

<p>She looked like a pale flame, as she stood there.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten, Stelio, that I was to take you to the
closed house."</p>

<p>Like one lost in a desert, she stood there, helpless,
under the gray sky.</p>

<p>"It seemed to me that we were to go somewhere else.
But we are already here. 'In time'!"</p>

<p>She appeared to him now as she had in that memorable
night, when she had said "Do not be cruel, Stelio!"
Clothed in her sweet, tender soul she stood there, so
easy to kill, to destroy, to immolate in a bloodless sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come away&mdash;let us go," he said, trying to lead her
with him. "Let us go somewhere else."</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"Let us go home&mdash;let us go to your house; we will
light a fire, the first fire of October. Let me pass this
evening with you, Foscarina. It will rain soon. It would
be so sweet to sit in your room and talk, or be silent,
hand-in-hand. Come! Let us go."</p>

<p>He would have liked to take her in his arms, to nurse
her, soothe her, charm away her sadness. The sweetness
of his own words augmented his tenderness. Of
all her lovable person, he loved most fondly the delicate
little lines that radiated from the corners of her eyes to
her temples, the little purple veins that made her eyelids
look like violets, the curve of her cheeks, the pointed
chin, and all that seemed touched by the finger of Autumn,
every shadow that overspread that passionate face.</p>

<p>"Foscarina! Foscarina!"</p>

<p>Whenever he called her by her real name, his heart
beat faster, as if something more deeply human had entered
into his love, as if suddenly her whole past had
seized once more the figure he was pleased to isolate in
his dream, and as if innumerable threads formed a bond
uniting it more closely than ever to implacable life.</p>

<p>"Come! Let us go!"</p>

<p>She smiled pensively.</p>

<p>"But why? The house is very near. Let us pass it by
the Calle Gambara. Do you not wish to know the story
of the Countess of Glanegg? Look! One would think
it a convent."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The street was deserted as the path leading to a hermitage;
it was gray, damp, strewn with dead leaves.
The east wind had brought a light, warm mist that softened
all sounds.</p>

<p>"Behind those walls, a desolate soul survives the beauty
of its body," said La Foscarina softly. "Look! The
windows are closed, the blinds are nailed, the doors are
sealed. Only one door is still open for the servants, and
through it they carry the dead woman her nourishment,
though she is walled up as if in an Egyptian tomb. The
servants feed a body that no longer has the spirit of life."</p>

<p>The naked trees, which rose to the top of the cloister-like
enclosure, looked almost smoky in the mist; the
sparrows, more numerous than the leaves, twittered incessantly.</p>

<p>"Guess the Countess's name, Stelio. It is beautiful
and rare&mdash;as beautiful as if you had originated it."</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Radiana! The prisoner is called Radiana."</p>

<p>"But whose prisoner is she?"</p>

<p>"The prisoner of Time, Stelio. Time stands on guard
at her door, with his scythe and hour-glass, as she is
shown in old prints."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to describe an allegory?"</p>

<p>A boy passed, whistling. When he saw the two
strangers looking at the closed windows, he stopped to
gaze too, his large eyes full of curiosity and astonishment.
They were silent. Presently the little boy grew
tired of staring; nothing interesting could be seen; the
windows were not opened; everything was motionless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
so he ran away. They heard the flight of his little bare
feet on the wet stones and rotting leaves.</p>

<p>"Well," said Stelio, "and what did Radiana do? You
have not yet told me who is this woman, nor the reason
why she is a recluse. Tell me her story. I have already
been thinking of Soranza Soranzo."</p>

<p>"The Countess Glanegg is one of the greatest ladies
of the aristocratic Viennese world, and perhaps the most
beautiful I ever have seen. Franz Lenbach has painted
her in the armor of the Valkyries, with the four-winged
helmet. Have you ever visited his red studio in the
Palazzo Borghese?"</p>

<p>"No, never."</p>

<p>"Go there some day, and ask him to show you that
portrait. You will see it unchanged, as I see it now
through all those walls. She has wished to remain like
that in the memory of those that saw her in the splendor
of her beauty. One day, when the sun shone too bright,
she saw that the time had come for that beauty to fade,
and she resolved to take leave of the world in such a
way that men should not be witnesses of the decay and
destruction of her famous beauty. Perhaps it was her
sympathy with things that disintegrate and fall in ruins
that has kept her in Venice. She gave a magnificent farewell
banquet, where she appeared, still sovereignly beautiful;
then she withdrew forever from the world to this
house that you see, in this walled garden, where, alone
with her servants, she awaits the end. She has become
a legendary figure. They say that there are no mirrors
in her house, and that she has forgotten her own face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
She has forbidden even her most devoted friends and
her nearest relatives to visit her. How does she live?
What are her thoughts? By what means does she wile
away the time of waiting? Is her soul in a state of
grace?"</p>

<p>Every pause in that veiled voice questioning the mystery
was filled with deepest melancholy.</p>

<p>"Does she pray? Does she contemplate? Does she
weep? Or, perhaps, has she become inert, and suffers
no more than a withered apple in the back of some old
closet."</p>

<p>"What if she should suddenly show herself at that
window?" said Stelio, feeling something like a real sensation,
as he fancied he heard a creaking hinge.</p>

<p>Both looked closely at the nailed blinds.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she is sitting behind them, looking at us,"
he added, in a half whisper.</p>

<p>This thought made them both shudder.</p>

<p>They were leaning against a wall facing the house,
and did not wish to move a step. The encircling inertia
affected them, the smoke-like mist enveloped them more
and more thickly; the chatter of the birds lulled their
senses as a drug given to feverish patients. The siren
whistles pierced the air from afar. The brown leaves
dropped from the trees. How long it took for a floating
leaf to reach the earth! All around them was mist,
heaviness, slow consumption, ashes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
AFTER THE STORM</h2>


<p>"I must die, my dear&mdash;I must die!" said La
Foscarina, in a heart-rending voice, after a
long silence, raising her face from the cushions
where she had buried it, after a stormy
scene of passion, in which the ardent words of her beloved
had given her as much pain as pleasure.</p>

<p>She looked at Stelio, who had thrown himself, half
reclining, on a divan near the balcony, and now lay
silent, his eyes half-closed, his disordered hair touched
with a ray of gold from the setting sun. She realized
that she was possessed by an incurable madness, spreading
throughout her declining body. Lost! Lost! She
was irrevocably lost!</p>

<p>"Die?" said her beloved, in a dreamy voice, without
moving or opening his eyes, as if he were wrapped in
a melancholy trance.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;die&mdash;before you hate me!"</p>

<p>Stelio opened his eyes quickly, raised himself erect and
held up one hand, as if to prevent her from saying more.</p>

<p>"Ah, why do you torment yourself in this way?" he
said.</p>

<p>He saw that she was ivory pale; her hair fell in wandering
wavy locks over her cheeks; she seemed consumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
by some corrosive poison; her face was full of
terror and misery.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with me? What are we both
doing?" she exclaimed in anguish.</p>

<p>"I love you!"</p>

<p>"Not as I wish, not as I have dreamed; I do not wish
to be loved thus."</p>

<p>"But you set my heart on fire, and then madness
seizes me."</p>

<p>"It is like the madness of hatred."</p>

<p>"No, no; do not say that!"</p>

<p>"Your fierceness makes me feel that you hate me&mdash;that
you even wish to kill me."</p>

<p>"But you make me blind, I tell you, and then I know
not what I say or do."</p>

<p>"What is it that maddens you so? What do you see
in me?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I know not&mdash;I cannot tell!"</p>

<p>"But I know very well what it is!"</p>

<p>"Why do you torment yourself, I say? I love you!
This is the love...."</p>

<p>"That condemns me! I must die of it! Call me once
more by the name you gave me long ago."</p>

<p>"You are mine! You belong to me, and I will not lose
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will lose me."</p>

<p>"But why? I do not understand. What wild fancy
is this of yours? Does my love offend you? Do you not
love me in the same way?"</p>

<p>His irritation and misunderstanding only aggravated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
her suffering. She covered her face with her hands. Her
heart throbbed with hammer-like beating in her rigid
breast, seeming to echo in her brain.</p>

<p>Presently she raised her head and looked at him with
painful effort.</p>

<p>"I have a heart, Stelio," she said, with trembling lips,
as if she were struggling with a sort of fierce timidity
in order to force herself to speak those words. "I suffer
from a heart, too keenly alive&mdash;oh, Stelio, alive and eager
and anguished as you never will know...."</p>

<p>She smiled the sweet, faint smile with which she sought
to disguise her suffering; hesitated a moment, then
reached toward a bunch of violets, which she took and
pressed close to her lips. Her eyelids drooped, her classic
brow, between her dark hair and the flowers, showed
its ivory-like beauty.</p>

<p>"You wound my heart sometimes, Stelio," she said
softly, her lips still caressing the violets. "Sometimes
you are cruel to it."</p>

<p>It seemed as if those fragrant, humble blossoms helped
her to confess her sadness, to veil still more the timid
reproach she had made to her beloved. She was silent;
Stelio bowed his head. The logs on the hearth crackled;
the autumn rain fell monotonously in the fading garden.</p>

<p>"I long for kindness, with a thirst that you never
will understand. For that deep, true kindness, dear
friend, which does not speak but which comprehends,
which knows how to give all in a single look or a single
movement; which is strong, sure, always armed against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the evil impulse that tempts us. Do you know the sort
of kindness I mean?"</p>

<p>Her voice, alternately strong and wavering, was so
warm with inner light, was so full of revelation of a
soul, that it passed through the young man's blood more
like a spiritual essence than a sound.</p>

<p>"In you, yes, Foscarina, I know it."</p>

<p>He took in his own hands the slender hands that lay
filled with violets on her lap; he bowed his head low
over them and kissed them submissively. Then he knelt
at her feet, in the same submission. The delicate perfume
seemed to arouse his tenderness. During the long
pause the fire and the rain continued their murmured
speech.</p>

<p>Suddenly she asked in a clear voice:</p>

<p>"Do you think that I believe myself sure of you?"</p>

<p>"Have you not watched over my slumbers?" he replied,
but in an altered tone, for he was suddenly seized
by a new emotion: with her query he had seen rise before
him her naked soul; and he felt that that soul had
penetrated his own, and recognized his secret yearning
for the belief and confidence of others in himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what does that prove?" was her reply.
"Youth sleeps quietly on any pillow. You are young"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I love you and I have faith in you! I give myself
entirely to you. You are my life's companion, and your
hand is strong."</p>

<p>He saw the well known sadness in the lines of that
loved face, and his voice trembled with tenderness.</p>

<p>"Kindness!" said she, caressing with light touch the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
hair on his temples. "You know how to be kind&mdash;you
even feel a need to comfort at times. But a fault has
been committed, and it calls for expiation. Once it
seemed to me that for you I could do the humblest as
well as the highest things; but now I feel that I can
do only one thing&mdash;to go away, disappear, and leave you
free with your destiny."</p>

<p>He interrupted her by springing to his feet and taking
the loved face between his hands.</p>

<p>"I can do this, which love alone could not do," she
said softly, turning pale, and looking at him with an
expression he never had seen before.</p>

<p>Stelio felt that he held her soul in his hands&mdash;a living
spring, infinitely beautiful and precious.</p>

<p>"Foscarina, Foscarina! my soul, my life! Yes, you
can give me more than love&mdash;I know it well, and nothing
is worth to me that which you give me; no other offer
could console me for not having you beside me on my
way. Believe me, believe! I have said this to you so
often&mdash;don't you remember?&mdash;even before you became all
my own, when the compact still held between us"&mdash;</p>

<p>Still holding her face between his palms, he leaned over
and kissed her passionately on her lips.</p>

<p>This time she shivered; the glacial flood she felt at
times seemed passing over her.</p>

<p>"No! no!" she pleaded, turning away from the young
man. Dreamily she bent to gather up the scattered
violets.</p>

<p>"The compact!" she said, after an interval of silence.
"Why have we violated it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Stelio's eyes were fixed on the changeful splendor of
the fire on the hearth, but in his open hands lingered the
strange sensation, the trace of a miracle&mdash;that human
face over which, through its sad pallor, had passed a
wave of sublime beauty.</p>

<p>"Why?" the woman repeated sadly. "Ah, confess&mdash;confess
that you, too, before we were seized with the
blind madness of that night, felt that the higher life was
about to be devastated and lost; that we must not yield
if we wished to save the good that remained in us&mdash;that
powerful, intoxicating thing which seemed to be the only
treasure left in my life. Confess, Stelio! speak the truth!
I can almost name the exact moment when the better
voice spoke to you in warning. Was it not on the water,
on the way home, when we had with us&mdash;Donatella?"</p>

<p>Before pronouncing that name she had hesitated a
second, then she felt an almost physical bitterness&mdash;a
bitterness that descended from her lips to the depths
of her soul, as if the syllables held poison for her. She
awaited his reply with suffering. "I do not know how
to think about the past, Fosca," the young man replied;
"moreover, I do not wish to think about it. I have lost
no good attribute that belonged to me. It pleases me
that your soul springs to your ripe lips, heavy with
sweetness, and that your fair cheek pales when I embrace
you."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" she begged. "Do not speak like that!
Do not prevent me from saying what it is that troubles
me! Why do you not help me?"</p>

<p>She shrank back among the cushions, and looked fixedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
at the fire, to avoid meeting the eyes of her beloved.</p>

<p>"More than once I have seen a look in your eyes that
has filled me with horror," she said at last, with a touch
of hoarseness in her effort to speak.</p>

<p>Stelio started, but dared not contradict her.</p>

<p>"Yes, with horror," she repeated, in a clearer tone,
implacable against herself, having already triumphed
over her fear and regained her courage.</p>

<p>Both were now face to face with the truth.</p>

<p>She continued without faltering.</p>

<p>"The first time I saw it was out there in the garden&mdash;that
night&mdash;you know! I understood then what it
was you saw in me; all the mire over which I have
walked, all the infamy that clung to my feet, all the impurity
for which I have so much disgust! Ah, you could
not have acknowledged the visions that kindled your
thoughts that night! Your eyes were cruel and your
mouth was convulsed. When you felt that you wounded
my sensitiveness, you took pity on me. But then&mdash;but
since then"&mdash;</p>

<p>Her face was covered with blushes; her voice had
grown impetuous, and her eyes were brilliant.</p>

<p>"To have nourished for years, with all the best that
was in me, a sentiment of devotion and unbounded admiration,
near you or from afar, in joy and in sadness;
to have accepted in the purest spirit all the consolation
offered by you to mankind through your poetry, and to
have awaited eagerly other gifts, even higher and more
consoling; to have believed in the great force of your
genius since its dawn, and never to have relaxed my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
watch over your ascent, and to have accompanied it
with a wish that has been my morning and evening
prayer all these years; to have continued, with silent
fervor, the effort to give some beauty and harmony to my
own spirit, that it might be more worthy to approach
yours; so many times, on the stage, before an ardent
audience, to have pronounced with a thrill some immortal
phrase, thinking of those which perhaps one day you
would communicate to mankind through my lips; to have
worked without respite, to have tried always to rise to
a higher and simpler form in my art, to have aspired
unceasingly to perfection, fearing that nothing less would
please you, that otherwise I should seem inferior to your
dream; to have loved my fleeting glory only because
some day it might serve yours; to have hastened, with
the fervent confidence of faith, the latest of your revelations,
that I might offer myself to you as the instrument
of your victory before my own decay; against all and
everything, to have defended this secret ideal in my soul,
against all and against myself as much as against others;
to have made of you my melancholy, my steadfast hope,
my heroic test, the symbol of all things good, strong,
and free&mdash;ah, Stelio! Stelio!"&mdash;</p>

<p>She paused an instant, overcome by that memory as
by a new shame.</p>

<p>"And then to have reached that dawn&mdash;to have seen
you leaving my house in that way on that horrible morning&mdash;Do
you remember?"</p>

<p>"I was happy&mdash;happy!" cried the young man, in a
stifled voice, pale and agitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no! Do you remember? You left me as you
would have left some light love, some passing fancy, after
a few hours of idle pastime."</p>

<p>"You deceive yourself!"</p>

<p>"Confess! Come, speak the truth. Only through truth
can we now hope to save ourselves."</p>

<p>"I was happy, I tell you; my whole heart expanded
with joy; I dreamed, I hoped, I felt as if I were born
anew."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!&mdash;happy to breathe freely, to feel your youth
in the breeze and the fresh air. What did you see in her
who in her renunciation had so many times suffered
keenly&mdash;yes, you know it well!&mdash;rather than break the
vow that she had taken and borne with her in her wanderings
over the earth? Tell me! what did you see in
me, if you did not believe me a corrupt creature, the
heroine of chance amours, the vagabond actress who in
her own life, as on the stage, may belong to any man
and every man?"</p>

<p>"Foscarina! Foscarina!"</p>

<p>Stelio leaned over her and closed her lips with a trembling
hand.</p>

<p>"No, no, do not say that! You are mad! Hush! hush!"</p>

<p>"It is horrible!" murmured the woman, sinking back
on the cushions, unnerved by her agitation, submerged
in the bitter wave that had flooded her heart.</p>

<p>But her eyes remained wide open, fixed as two crystal
orbs, hard as if they had no lashes, fastened on Stelio.
They prevented him from speaking, from denying or
softening the truth they had discovered. In a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
or two he found that gaze intolerable, and gently pressed
the lids down with the tips of his fingers, as one closes
the eyes of the dead. She noted the movement, which
was full of infinite melancholy; she felt that only tender
love and pity were in that touch. Her bitterness passed
away, her eyes grew moist. She extended her arms,
clasped them around his neck, and raised herself a little.
She seemed to be shutting her soul within herself, and
became once more gentle and weak, full of silent pleading.</p>

<p>"And so I must go," she sighed at last. "Is there no
help for it? Is there no pardon?"</p>

<p>"I love you!" her lover repeated.</p>

<p>She disengaged one arm, and held her open hand toward
the fire, as if to conjure fate. Then once more
she clasped her lover in a close embrace.</p>

<p>"Yes, still a little while! Let me remain with you a
little longer. Then I will go away; I will go somewhere,
far-away, and die on a stone under a tree. But let me
stay with you a little longer."</p>

<p>"I love you!"</p>

<p>The blind and indomitable forces of life were whirling
over them in that embrace. And because they realized
this with terror their clasp grew closer; and from
that embrace sprang an impulse, both good and evil, that
stirred them to the soul. In the silent room, the voices
of the elements spoke their obscure language, which was
like an uncomprehended reply to their mute questioning.
The fire, near them, and the rain, from without, discoursed,
replied, narrated. Little by little, these voices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
reached the spirit of the Animator, enticed it, charmed
it, drew it into the world of innumerable myths, born of
their eternity. His keener spiritual senses heard the deep
resonance of the two melodies expressing the intimate
essence of the two elementary wills&mdash;the two marvelous
melodies that he had found, to weave them into the symphonic
web of the new tragedy. Of a sudden, all sadness
and anxiety left him as in a happy truce, an interval
of enchantment. And the woman's clasp relaxed,
as if in obedience to some command of liberation.</p>

<p>"There is no help for it!" she repeated to herself,
seeming to repeat a formula of condemnation heard by
her in the same mysterious way that Stelio had heard
the wonderful melodies.</p>

<p>She leaned forward, resting her chin in her hand and
her elbow on her knee; and in this attitude she gazed
a long time into the fire, with a slight frown on her
brow.</p>

<p>As Stelio looked at her, his soul was troubled. He
yearned to find some way of breaking the iron band that
oppressed her, of dissipating that mist of sadness, of
leading his beloved back to joy.</p>

<p>The fire in its sudden burst of flame illumined her
face and hair; her forehead was as beautiful as a noble
manly brow; something natural and untamed was suggested
in the rippling waves and changeful hue of her
thick hair.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at so intently?" she said at
last, feeling his fixed gaze. "Have you found a gray
hair?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>He knelt before his love again, flexible and tender.</p>

<p>"I see only your beauty. In you I always find something
that delights me. I was looking then at the strange
wave of your hair here&mdash;a wave not made by the comb,
but by the storm!"</p>

<p>He slipped his fingers through the thick tresses. She
closed her eyes, feeling again the spell of his terrible
power over her.</p>

<p>"I see only your beauty. When you close your eyes
thus, I feel that you are mine to the depth of your heart&mdash;lost
in me, as the soul is one with the body: a single
life, mine and thine."</p>

<p>She listened in the half light, and his voice seemed
to come from a long distance, and to be speaking not to
her but to another woman; she felt as if she were overhearing
a lover's protestations to his mistress, and suddenly
fancied herself mad with jealousy, possessed by a
desire to kill, filled with a spirit of revenge; but that
body must remain motionless, her hands hanging at her
sides, nerveless and powerless.</p>

<p>"You are my delight and my inspiration. You have
a stimulating power of which you are unconscious. Your
simplest act suffices to reveal to me some truth of which
I was ignorant. And love is like the intellect: it shines
in the measure of the truth it discovers. Why, why do
you grieve yourself? Nothing is destroyed, nothing is
lost. It was intended that we should be united, so that
together we might rise to joy and triumph. It was necessary
that I should be free and happy in your true and
perfect love in order to create the work of beauty that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
so many men expect of me. I need your faith; I need
to pass through joy and to create. Your presence alone
suffices to inspire my mind with incalculable fruitfulness.
Just now, when your arms held me close, I heard a
sudden torrent of music, a flood of melody, passing
through the silence."</p>

<p>To whom was he speaking? Whom did he ask for
joy? Was not his imperious demand for music a yearning
toward her that sang, transfiguring the universe with
her song? Of whom, if not of fresh youth and maidenhood,
could he ask joy and creation? While she had held
him in her embrace, it was the other woman who had
sung and spoken within him! And now, now&mdash;to whom
was he speaking, if not to that other woman? She alone
could give him what was necessary for his art and his
life. The maiden was a new force, a closed beauty, an
unused weapon, keen and magnificent for the intoxication
of war. Malediction! Malediction!</p>

<p>Mingled sorrow and anger stirred her heart, in that
vibrating darkness which she dared not leave. She suffered
the torments of a nightmare; as if she were rolling
toward a precipice with the indestructible burden of
her vanished years&mdash;years of misery and of triumph&mdash;her
fading face with its thousand masks, her despairing
soul, and the thousand other souls that had inhabited
her mortal body. This grand passion of her life, which
was to have saved her, seemed now to be pushing her
relentlessly toward ruin and death. In order to reach
her, and through her to attain to his highest joy, the
passion of her beloved was compelled to make its way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
through what he believed to be a multitude of unknown
loves; it would contaminate, corrupt and embitter itself,
perhaps even change by slow degrees to disgust. Always
that shadowy multitude must keep alive in him that instinct
of brutal ferocity which lurked in his strong nature.
Ah, what had she done? She herself had armed a furious
devastator, and had put him between her friend and
herself. No escape was possible. She herself, on that
night of the flame, had led before him the fresh and
beautiful prey, of whom he had taken possession by one
of those looks that are a choice and a promise. To whom
was he speaking now, if not to that other woman. Of
whom did he ask joy?</p>

<p>"Do not be sad! do not be sad!"</p>

<p>But now she heard his words only confusedly, more
faint than before, as if her soul had sunk into a chasm;
but she felt his impatient hands as they touched her
caressingly. And, in that red darkness, wherein, as it
seemed to her, all madnesses and folly were born, she
felt a surging revolt in her veins.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to take you to her? Do you wish
me to call her to you?" cried the unhappy woman, suddenly
opening her eyes with an expression that astonished
Stelio; she seized his wrists and shook him with a
grasp so tight that he felt her nails in his flesh. "Go!
go! She awaits you! Why do you remain here? Go,
run! She awaits you!"</p>

<p>She sprang up, raising him at the same time, and tried
to push him toward the door. She was no longer recognizable,
transfigured by fury into a dangerous, threatening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
creature. The strength of her hands was incredible,
like the energy of evil intent in her whole being.</p>

<p>"Who awaits me? What did you say? What is the
matter with you? Come back to your senses, Foscarina!"</p>

<p>He stammered his appeal, he trembled, fancying he saw
madness in that distorted face. But she was like one
distraught and heard him not.</p>

<p>"Foscarina!" He called her with all his soul, white
with terror, as if to stop with his cry her escaping reason.</p>

<p>She gave a great start, opened her hands, and gazed
around as if just roused from a long sleep, of which she
remembered nothing.</p>

<p>"Come, sit down."</p>

<p>He led her back to the cushions, and gently made her
settle herself among them. She allowed herself to be
soothed by his solicitous tenderness. Presently she
moaned:</p>

<p>"Who has beaten me?"</p>

<p>She felt of her bruised arms, and touched her face
lightly, trembling as if she were cold.</p>

<p>"Come; lie down! Put your head here."</p>

<p>He made her lie on the couch; disposed her head comfortably,
put a light cushion over her feet, softly and carefully,
leaning over her as over a dear invalid, giving
up to her all his heart still throbbing with fear.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she repeated, in a voice no louder than a
sigh, at each movement he made, as if she would prolong
the sweetness of these cares.</p>

<p>"Are you cold?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I cover you with something?" Stelio inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He sought for some wrap, and found on a table a piece
of antique velvet, which he spread over her. She smiled
faintly.</p>

<p>"Are you comfortable like that?"</p>

<p>She made an affirmative sign by simply closing her
eyelids.</p>

<p>Stelio gathered up the violets, now warm and languid,
and laid them on the pillow near her head.</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>Her eyelids drooped even more slightly than before.
He kissed her forehead, amid the perfume of the violets;
then he turned to stir the fire, putting on more wood
and raising a fine blaze.</p>

<p>"Do you feel the heat? Are you getting warm?" he
asked softly.</p>

<p>He approached and bent over the poor soul. She slept;
the contraction of her face had relaxed, and the lines of
her mouth were composed in the equal rhythm of sleep;
a calm like that of death spread over her pale face.
"Sleep! Sleep!" He was so moved by love and pity that
he would have liked to transfuse into that slumber an
infinite virtue of consolation and forgetfulness.</p>

<p>He remained standing on the rug, watching her, counting
her respirations. Those lips had said: "I can do
one thing that love alone cannot do." Those lips had
said: "Do you wish me to take you to her? Do you
wish me to call her to you?" He neither judged nor
resolved, but let his thoughts scatter. Once again he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
felt the blind, indomitable forces of life whirling over his
head, over that sleeping form, and also his terrible desire
to cling to life. "The bow is named BIOS, and its
work is death."</p>

<p>In the silence, the fire and the rain continued to talk.
The voice of the elements, the woman sleeping in her
sadness, the imminence of fate, the immensity of the future,
remembrance and presentiment, all these things
created in his mind a state of musical mystery wherein
the yet unwritten work surged anew and illumined his
thought. He listened to his melodies developing themselves
indefinitely, and heard a personage in the drama
say: "This alone quenches our thirst, and all the thirst
in us turns eagerly toward this freshness. If it did not
exist, none could live here; we should all die of thirst."
He saw a country furrowed by the dry, white bed of
an ancient river, dotted with bonfires which lighted up
the extraordinarily calm, pure evening. He saw a funereal
gleam of gold, a tomb filled with corpses all covered
with gold, and the crowned corpse of Cassandra among
the sepulchral urns. A voice said: "How soft her ashes
are! They run between the fingers like the sands of the
sea." Another voice said: "She speaks of a shadow that
passes over things, and of a damp sponge that effaces
all traces." Then night fell; stars sparkled, the myrtles
breathed perfume, and a voice said: "Ah! Behold the
statue of Niobe! Before dying, Antigone sees a stone
statue whence gushes an eternal fountain of tears." The
error of the age had passed away; the remoteness of centuries
was abolished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
A FALLEN GIANT</h2>


<p>One afternoon in November, Stelio returned on
the steamer from the Lido, accompanied by
Daniele Glauro. They had left behind them
the thunder of the greenish waves of the Adriatic,
the trees of San Niccolò despoiled by a predaceous
wind, whirlwinds of dead leaves, heroic phantoms of departures
and arrivals, the memory of the archers playing
to win the scarlet ensign, and the mad rides of Lord
Byron, devoured by the desire to surpass his own destiny.</p>

<p>"I too, to-day, would have given a kingdom for a
horse," said Effrena, in self-ridicule, irritated by the mediocrity
of life. "Not a cross-bow nor a horse in San
Niccolò, not even the courage of an oarsman! <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perge
andacter!</i> So here we are, on this ignoble gray carcass
that smokes and seethes like a kettle. Look at Venice,
dancing down there!"</p>

<p>The anger of the waves was extending to the lagoon.
The waters were agitated by a violent wind, and the
agitation seemed to reach to the foundations of the city,
and the palaces, cupolas, and campaniles appeared to
heave like vessels on the water. Clusters of floating seaweed
showed their white roots; and flocks of sea-gulls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
circled in the wind, their strange, wild laughter echoing
above the crested waves.</p>

<p>"Wagner!" Daniele Glauro said suddenly, in a low
tone, touched with emotion, as he pointed at an old
man leaning against the railing of a prow. "There he
is, with Franz Liszt and Donna Cosima. Do you see
him?"</p>

<p>Stelio's heart beat quicker; for him too all other surrounding
figures disappeared; his bitter sense of ennui
and inertia disappeared; and he felt remaining only the
suggestion of superhuman power evoked by that name,
and realized that the only reality hovering over all those
indistinct phantoms was the ideal world conjured up by
that name around the little old man leaning over the
troubled waters.</p>

<p>Victorious genius, fidelity of love, unchangeable friendship,
the supreme apparitions of heroic nature, were reassembled
in silent union beneath the tempestuous sky.
The same dazzling whiteness crowned the three heads,
whose hair had become blanched through sadness. A
troubled sorrow was revealed in their faces and attitudes,
as if the same undefined presentiment oppressed their
blended spirits. The white face of the woman had a
beautiful, strong mouth, with clear-cut lines, revealing a
tenacious soul; and her light, steel-like eyes were fixed
continually on him who had chosen her for the companion
of his noble warfare, watching over him who, having
vanquished all hostile forces, would be powerless to vanquish
Death, whose menace perpetually pursued him.
That feminine vigil, full of fear, opposed itself to the invisible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
gaze of the other Woman, and threw around the
old man a vague, funereal shadow.</p>

<p>"He seems to be suffering," said Daniele Glauro. "Do
you not see? He seems almost on the point of swooning.
Shall we go to them?"</p>

<p>Effrena looked with inexpressible emotion at those
white locks blown about by the sharp wind on the aged
neck under the broad brim of the felt hat, and at the
almost livid ear, with its swollen lobe. That body, which
had withstood the keenest warfare by the proud instinct
of its own domination, now looked as limp as some rag
which the wind could bear away and destroy.</p>

<p>"Ah, Daniele! what can we do for him?" said Stelio,
yielding to an almost religious impulse to manifest in
some way his reverence and pity for that great oppressed
heart.</p>

<p>"What can we do?" repeated Glauro, to whom that
ardent desire to offer something of himself to the hero
now suffering the human fate had immediately communicated
itself. Their souls were blended in that impulse
of fervor and gratitude, that sudden exaltation of
their innate nobility; but they could give nothing more
than that. Nothing could check the secret ravages of
the fatal malady; and both were filled with profound
sorrow as they saw the snowy hair tossed about on the
old man's neck by the wind coming from afar, and bringing
to the quivering lagoon the murmur and the foam
of the open sea.</p>

<p>"Ah, glorious sea, thou shalt hear me still! Never
shall I find on the earth the health I seek. To thee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
therefore, will I remain faithful, O waves of the boundless
sea!" The impetuous harmonies of <cite>The Flying Dutchman</cite>
returned to Effrena's memory, with the despairing
call that pierces through them from time to time; he
fancied that in the rushing wind he could hear again the
wild chant of the crew on the ship with the blood-red
sails: <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Iohohé! Iohohé!</i> come ashore, black Captain!
Seven years have passed!" Again his imagination conjured
up the figure of Richard Wagner in youth; he saw
once more the lonely one wandering in the living horror
of Paris, poor yet undaunted, devoured by the fever of
genius, his eyes fixed on his star, and his mind resolved
to force the world to recognize it. In the myth of the
shadowy captain, the exiled one had seen the image of
his own breathless race, his furious struggle, his supreme
hope. "But some day the pale hero may be delivered,
should he meet on earth a woman that will be faithful
to him until death."</p>

<p>The woman was there, beside the hero, an ever vigilant
guardian. She too, like Senta, knew the sovereign
law of fidelity; and death was soon to dissolve the sacred
vow.</p>

<p>"Do you think that, steeped as he is in poetic myths,
he has dreamed of some extraordinary manner of dying,
and that he now prays every day to Nature to conform
his end to his dream?" said Glauro, thinking of the
mysterious will that induced the eagle to mistake for a
rock the brow of Æschylus, and led Petrarch to die
alone over the pages of a book. "What would be an end
worthy of him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"A new melody of unheard-of power, which in his
youth had been to him indistinct and impossible to fix,
should suddenly rend his soul like a terrible sword."</p>

<p>"True!" said Glauro.</p>

<p>The wind-driven clouds were battling in phalanxes
through space; the towers and cupolas seemed swaying
in the background; the shadows of city and sky, equally
vast and mobile on the troubled waters, alternately
changed and blended, as if they had been produced by
things equally near dissolution.</p>

<p>"Look at the Magyar, Daniele; there is a generous soul!
He has served the hero with boundless faith and devotion;
and by this service, more than by his art, he has
won glory. But see how this very feeling, so strong
and so sincere, inspires him with almost theatrical affectation,
because of his continual wish to impose upon
his spectators a magnificent image of himself, which
shall delude them."</p>

<p>The Abbé Liszt straightened his thin and bony frame,
which seemed encased by a coat of mail, and drawing
himself to his full height he bared his head to pray, addressing
a mute prayer to the God of Tempests. The
wind stirred his thick white hair, that leonine mane that
at times seemed to emit electric currents which affected
his listeners, and many women. His magnetic eyes were
raised to heaven, while the words of his inaudible prayer
moved his thin lips, lending a mystic air to that face so
deeply furrowed with wrinkles.</p>

<p>"What matters it?" said Glauro. "He possesses the
divine faculty of fervor and a taste for all-powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
strength and dominating passion. Does not his art aspire
toward Prometheus, Orpheus, Dante, Tasso? He
was attracted by Richard Wagner as by some great force
of nature; perhaps he heard in him the theme he has attempted
to express in his symphonic poem: 'That which
is heard on the Mountain'."</p>

<p>"That may be," said Effrena.</p>

<p>But both started on seeing the old man turn suddenly,
with the gesture of one groping in darkness, and clutch
convulsively at his companion, who uttered a cry. They
ran toward the group. Everyone on the boat crowded
around them, struck by that cry of anguish. A look from
the woman prevented the curious from venturing too
close to the apparently lifeless body. She herself supported
him, laid him on a bench, felt his pulse, and bent
over to listen to his heart-beats. Her love and her
grief traced an inviolable circle around the stricken one.
The bystanders stepped back and waited in silence,
anxiously looking on that livid face for signs of either
life or death.</p>

<p>The face was still and pale, as it lay on the woman's
knees. Two deep furrows descended along the cheeks
toward the half-open mouth, deepening near the imperious
nose. Puffs of wind ruffled the thin, fine hair
on the full forehead, and the white collar of beard below
the square chin where the vigor of the jawbone was visible
through the wrinkled skin. The temples were covered
with perspiration, and one of the feet twitched
slightly. The smallest detail of that fallen figure impressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
itself forever on the minds of the two young
men.</p>

<p>How long did his suffering endure? The shadows continued
to float over the dark water, broken at intervals
by long shafts of sun-rays that appeared to pierce the
air and bury themselves like arrows in the dark waves.
The regular cadence of the engine beat upon the air;
and now arose the wild laughter of the sea-gulls, and a
sort of dull, prolonged moan from the tempest-stricken
city.</p>

<p>"We must carry him," said Stelio in his friend's ear;
he was intoxicated by the sadness of the situation and
by the solemnity of his own visions.</p>

<p>The motionless face gave a slight sign of returning
life.</p>

<p>"Yes, let us offer our services," said Glauro, whose
face was pale.</p>

<p>They looked at the woman with the snow-white cheeks;
then they advanced and offered their arms.</p>

<p>How long did that terrible removal last? The distance
from the boat to the shore was not great, but those
few steps seemed a long journey. The waves dashed
against the posts of the pier; the distant moan came to
them from the Grand Canal as if from the winding paths
of a cavern; the bells of San Marco rang for vespers;
but this confusion of sounds had lost all immediate reality,
and seemed infinitely profound and distant, like a
lament of the ocean itself.</p>

<p>In their arms they bore the Hero's body&mdash;the unconscious
form of him who had inundated the world with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
flood of melody from his oceanic soul, the mortal being
of the Revealer who had translated into infinite song the
essence of the Universe for man's adoration. With an
ineffable thrill of terror and joy, such as would stir a
man who should see a mighty river dashing itself over
vast rocks, a volcano bursting into flame, a conflagration
devouring a forest, a dazzling meteor obscuring the
light of the stars, Effrena felt beneath the hand that he
had slipped under the shoulder to sustain the body&mdash;and
he paused an instant to gather his strength, which was
failing him, and gazed at that white head against his
breast&mdash;he felt the renewed beating of that sacred heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
THE MASTER'S VISION</h2>


<p>"You were strong, Daniele&mdash;you who can hardly
break a twig! And he was heavy, that old
barbarian; his body seemed built over a
framework of bronze: well constructed, firm,
able to stand on a deck that might rise and fall&mdash;the
body of a man that nature destined for the sea. Whence
came your strength, Daniele? I almost feared for you,
but you did not even stagger. Do you realize that we
have borne a hero in our arms? This is a day we ought
to distinguish and celebrate in some way. His eyes
opened again and looked into mine; his pulse revived
under my hand. We were worthy to carry him, Daniele,
because of our fervor."</p>

<p>"You are worthy not only to carry him, but of gathering
and preserving some of the most beautiful promises
offered by his art to men who still have hope."</p>

<p>"Ah, if only I am not overwhelmed by my own abundance,
and if I can master the anxiety that suffocates
me, Daniele!"</p>

<p>The two friends walked on and on, side by side, in
exalted and confident mood, as if their friendship had
taken on an added nobility.</p>

<p>"It seems as if the Adriatic had overthrown the Murazzi,
in this tempest," said Daniele, pausing to look at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the waves that had mounted even to the Piazza. "We
must return."</p>

<p>"No, let us cross the ferry. Here is a boat. Look at
the reflection of San Marco on the water!"</p>

<p>The boatman rowed them to the Torre dell' Orologio.
The rising tide soon overflowed the Piazza, looking like
a lake surrounded by porticoes, reflecting the greenish-yellow
twilight sky.</p>

<p>"EN VERUS FORTIS QUI FREGIT VINCULA
MORTIS," read Stelio on the curve of an arch, below a
mosaic of the Resurrection. "Did you know that Richard
Wagner held his first colloquy with Death in Venice,
exactly twenty years ago, at the time he produced Tristan?
Consumed by a hopeless passion, he came here to
die in silence, and here he composed that wild second
act, which is a hymn to eternal night. And now fate
has led him back to the lagoons. Fate, it seems, has
decreed that here he shall breathe his last, like Claudio
Monteverde. Is not Venice full of musical desire, immense
and indefinable? Every sound transforms itself
into an expressive voice. Listen!"</p>

<p>The city of stone and water seemed indeed to have
become as sonorous as a great organ. The hissing and
moaning had changed to a sort of choral supplication,
rising and falling in regular rhythm.</p>

<p>"Do you not hear the theme of a melody in that chorus
of moans? Listen!"</p>

<p>They had debarked from the little boat, and had resumed
their walk through the narrow streets.</p>

<p>"Listen!" Stelio repeated. "I can detect a melodic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
theme, which swells and decreases without power to
develop itself. Do you hear it?"</p>

<p>"It is not given to me to hear what you hear," replied
the sterile ascetic to the genius. "I will await the time
when you can repeat to me the word that Nature speaks
to you."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Stelio resumed, "to be able to restore to melody
its natural simplicity, its ingenuous perfection, its divine
innocence; to draw it, living, from its eternal source,
from the true mystery of nature, the inmost soul of
the Universe! Have you ever reflected upon the myth
connected with the infancy of Cassandra? She had
been left one night in the temple of Apollo; and in the
morning she was found lying on the marble floor,
wrapped in the coils of a serpent that licked her ears.
And from that day she understood all the voices of
Nature in the air, all the melodies of the world. The
power of the great seeress was only a high musical
power; and a part of that Apollonian virtue entered the
souls of the poets that coöperated in the creation of the
tragic Chorus. One of those poets boasted of understanding
the voices of all birds; another was able to hold
converse with the winds; another comprehended perfectly
the language of the sea. More than once I have
dreamed that I too was lying on the marble floor, folded
in the coils of that serpent. The magic of that old myth
must be renewed, Daniele, in order that we may create
the new art.</p>

<p>"Have you ever thought what might be the music of
that species of pastoral ode sung by the Chorus in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
<cite>&#338;dipus Tyrannus</cite>, &#338;when Jocasta flees, horror-struck, and
the son of Laïus still cherishes the illusion of a last
hope? Do you recall it? Try to imagine the strophes as
if they were a frame, within which an expressive dance-figure
is animated by the perfect life of melody. The
spirit of Earth would rise before you: the consoling apparition
of the great common Mother at the unhappiness
of her stricken, trembling children&mdash;a celebration, as
it were, of all that is divine and eternal above Man, who
is dragged to madness and death by blind and cruel
Destiny. Try now to conceive how this song has helped
me in the writing of my great tragedy to find the
means of the highest and at the same time the simplest
expression."</p>

<p>"Do you purpose, then, to reëstablish the ancient
Chorus on the stage?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I shall not revive any ancient form; I intend
to create a new form, obeying only my instinct and the
genius of my own race, as did the Greeks when they
created that marvelous structure of beauty, forever inimitable&mdash;the
Greek drama. For a very long time, the
three practicable arts of music, poetry, and dancing have
been separated; the first two have developed toward a
superior form of expression, but the third is in its decadence,
and I think that now it is impossible to combine
them in a single rhythmical structure without taking
from one or another its own dominant character, which
has already been acquired. If they are to blend in one
common effect, each must renounce its own particular
effect&mdash;in other words, become diminished. Among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
things most susceptible of rhythm, Language is the
foundation of every art that aspires to perfection. Do
you think that language is given its full value in the
Wagnerian drama? Do you not think that the musical
conception itself often loses some of its primitive purity
by being made to depend on matters outside the realm of
music? Wagner himself certainly realizes this weakness,
and shows it when he approaches a friend in Bayreuth,
covering his eyes with his hand, that he may
abandon his sense of hearing entirely to the virtue of
the pure sound of the voice."</p>

<p>"This is all new to me," said Glauro, "yet it rejoices
and intoxicates me as we rejoice when we hear something
that has been long foreseen and felt by presentiment.
Then, as I understand, you will not superpose
the three rhythmic arts, but will present them each in
its single manifestation, yet all linked by a sovereign
idea, and raised to the supreme degree by their own significant
energy?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Daniele! how can I give you any idea of the
work that lives within me?" Stelio exclaimed. "The
words you use in trying to formulate my meaning are
hard and mechanical."</p>

<p>They stood at the foot of the Rialto steps. The gale
swept over them; the Grand Canal, dark in the shadow
of the palaces, seemed to bend like a river hastening
to a cataract.</p>

<p>"We cannot remain here," said Glauro, leaning against
a door; "the wind will blow us down."</p>

<p>"Go on; I will overtake you. Only a moment," cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the master, covering his eyes with his hand, and concentrating
his soul upon sound alone.</p>

<p>Formidable was the voice of the tempest, in the midst
of the immobility of centuries, turned to stone. Its
unaccompanied song, its hopeless, wailing lamentation,
was raised in memory of the multitudes that had become
ashes, the scattered pageants, the fallen grandeur, the
innumerable days of birth and of death&mdash;things of an
age without name or form. All the melancholy of the
world rushed in the wind over that eager, listening soul.</p>

<p>"Ah! I have seized you!" Stelio cried suddenly, with
triumphant joy.</p>

<p>The complete and perfect line of the melody had been
revealed to him, now belonged to him, and would become
immortal in his spirit and in the world.</p>

<p>"Daniele! I have found it!"</p>

<p>He raised his eyes, and saw the first stars in the
adamantine sky. He feared to lose the precious treasure
he had found. Near, a column he now saw a man
with a flickering light at the end of a long pole, and
heard the slight sound of the lighting of a lantern.
Swiftly and eagerly he jotted down in his notebook,
under the lamplight, the notes of the melodic theme,
compressing into five lines the message of the elements.</p>

<p>"O day of marvels!" said Daniele Glauro, on seeing
Stelio on the steps, as light and agile as if he had robbed
the air of some of its elasticity. "May Nature cherish
you forever, my brother!"</p>

<p>"Come, come!" said Stelio, taking him by the arm and
urging him on with boyish gayety. "I must run!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew him through the narrow streets leading to
San Giovanni Elemosinario.</p>

<p>"What you told me one day, Daniele, is quite true.
I mean that the voice of things is essentially different
from their sound," said Stelio. "The sound of the wind
may represent the moans of a frightened throng, the
howling of wild animals, the falling of cataracts, the
rustle of waving banners, or mockery, threats, and despair.
But the voice of the wind is the synthesis of all
these sounds: that is the voice which sings and tells
of the terrible travail of time, the cruelty of human
destiny, the eternal warfare for an illusion eternally
born anew."</p>

<p>"And have you never thought that the essence of
music does not lie in the sounds alone?" asked the mystic
doctor. "It often dwells in the silence that precedes
and follows sound. Rhythm makes itself felt in these
intervals of silence. Rhythm is the very heart of music,
but its pulsation is inaudible except during the intervals
between sounds."</p>

<p>This metaphysical law confirmed Stelio in his belief
of the justness of his own intuition.</p>

<p>"Imagine," said he, "an interval between two scenic
symphonies wherein all the <em>motifs</em> concur in expressing
the inmost essence of the characters that are struggling
in the drama as well as in revealing the inmost depths
of the action, as, for instance, in Beethoven's great prelude
in <cite>Leonora</cite>, or the prelude to <cite>Coriolanus</cite>. That musical
silence, pulsating with rhythm, is like the mysterious
living atmosphere where alone can appear words of pure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
poetry. Thus the personages seem to emerge from the
symphonic sea as if from the hidden truth that works
within them; their spoken words will possess an extraordinary
resonance in that rhythmic silence, will reach
the farthest limit of verbal power, because it will be
animated by a continuous aspiration to song that cannot
be appeased except by the melody which must rise again
from the orchestra, at the close of the tragic episode.
Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Then you place the episode between two symphonies,
which prepare it and also terminate it, because music is
the beginning and the end of human utterance."</p>

<p>"Thus I bring nearer to the spectator the personages
of the drama. Do you recall the figure employed by
Schiller in the ode he wrote in honor of Goethe's translation
of <cite>Mahomet</cite>, to signify that, on the stage, only the
ideal world seems real. The chariot of Thespis, like
the barque of Acheron, is so slight that it can carry
only shadows or the images of human beings. On the
stage commonly known, these images are so unreal that
any contact with them seems as impossible as would
be contact with mental forms. They are distant and
strange, but in making them appear in the rhythmic
silence, accompanied by music to the threshold of the
visible world, I shall be able to bring them marvelously
close, because I shall illumine the most secret depths
of the will that produces them. I shall reveal, in short,
the images painted on the veil and that which happens
beyond the veil. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>They were now entering the Campo di San Cassiano
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
lonely and deserted on the banks of the gray stream;
their voices and their footsteps echoed there as if in
an amphitheater of stone, distinct above the sound of
the Grand Canal, which made a rushing noise like that
of a river. A purple mist rose from the fever-laden
waters, spreading like a poisonous breath. Death
seemed to have reigned there a long time. The shutter
of a high window beat in the wind against the wall,
grinding on its hinges, a sign of abandonment and ruin.
But, in the mind of the Inspirer, all these appearances
produced extraordinary transfigurations. He saw again
the wild and solitary spot near the tomb of Mycenæ.
Myrtles flourished between the rugged rocks and the
cyclopic ruins. Beside a rock lay the rigid, pure body
of the Victim. In the death-like silence he could hear
the murmuring water and the intermittent breath of
the breeze among the myrtles.</p>

<p>"It was in an august place," said he, "that I had the
first vision of my new work&mdash;at Mycenæ, under the
gateway of the Lions, while I was re-reading <cite>Orestes</cite>.
Land of fire, country of thirst and delirium, birthplace of
Clytemnestra and of the Hydra, earth forever sterile
by the horror of the most tragic destiny that ever has
overtaken a human race. Have you ever thought about
that barbarian explorer who, after passing the greater
part of his existence among his drugs behind a counter,
undertook to find the tombs of the Atridæ among the
ruins of Mycenæ, and who one day (the sixth anniversary
of the event is of recent date) beheld the greatest
and strangest vision ever offered to mortal eyes? Have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
you ever pictured to yourself that fat Schliemann at
the moment when he discovered the most dazzling treasure
ever held by Death in the dark obscurity of the
earth for centuries&mdash;for thousands of years? Have you
ever fancied that this superhuman and terrible spectacle
might have been revealed to some one else&mdash;to a youthful
and fervent spirit, to a poet, a life-giver, to you, to
me, perhaps? Then the fever, the frenzy, the madness&mdash;Imagine!"</p>

<p>He was on fire and vibrating, suddenly swept away
by his own fancy as by a whirlwind. His seer's eyes
sparkled with the gleam of the buried treasure. Creative
force flowed to his brain as blood to his heart. He was
an actor in his own drama, with accent and movement
expressing transcendent beauty and passion, surpassing
the power of the spoken word, the limit of the letter.
And his brother spirit hung upon his speech, trembling
before the sudden splendor that proved to him the truth
of his own divinations.</p>

<p>"Imagine! Imagine that the earth in which you explore
is baleful&mdash;it must still exhale the miasma of
monstrous wickedness. The curse upon the Atridæ was
so terrific that some vestige of it must still have remained
to be feared in the dust that they once trod upon.
You are bewitched: the dead you seek and cannot find
are reincarnated in you, and breathe in your body with
the terrible breath with which Æschylus infused them,
huge and sanguinary as they appear in the <cite>Orestes</cite>,
pierced perpetually with the darts and flames of their
destiny. Hereafter, all the ideal life with which you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
have nourished yourself must assume the form and impress
of reality. And still you go on in this land of
thirst, at the foot of the bare mountain, enclosed within
the fascination of the dead city, always delving in the
earth, with those terrifying phantoms ever before your
eyes in the burning dust. At each thrust of the spade
you tremble to the very marrow, eager to see the face of
one of the Atridæ, still perfect, but with the signs still
visible of the violence he suffered, the inhuman carnage.
And behold it! the gold, the gold, the bodies, piles of
gold, bodies covered with gold"&mdash;</p>

<p>The Atridæ princes seemed to be lying there on the
stones, a miracle evoked in the obscurity of the pathway.
And the one who had evoked these images, as
well as his listener, shuddered at the same instant.</p>

<p>"A succession of tombs: fifteen bodies, intact, one lying
beside another, on a golden bed, with masks of gold
on their faces, their brows crowned with gold and
breasts bound with gold; and covering them, on their
forms, at their sides, at their feet, everywhere, a prodigality
of golden things, countless as the leaves falling
in a fairy forest. Do you see? Do you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I see! I see!"</p>

<p>"For a second, that man's soul has traversed hundreds
and thousands of years, has breathed the terrible legend,
has palpitated in the horror of the ancient carnage. For
a second, his soul has lived that antique life of violence.
The slain ones were all there: Agamemnon, Eurymedon,
Cassandra, and the royal escort, and for a moment they
lay under his eyes, motionless. Then&mdash;they vanished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
into nothingness&mdash;do you see?&mdash;like a vapor exhaled,
like scattered foam, like flying dust, like I know not what
frail and fleeting thing&mdash;engulfed in the same fatal
silence that surrounded their radiant immobility. And
there was only a handful of dust and a mass of gold!"
Daniele Glauro, deeply moved, seized his friend's hand;
and the Inspirer read in his faithful eyes the mute flame
of enthusiasm consecrated to the great work.</p>

<p>They stopped near a door in the dark wall. A mysterious
sense of distance possessed the mind of each,
as if their souls were lost in the mists of time; and they
fancied that behind that door an ancient people lived
enthralled by a changeless Destiny. The sound of a
rocking cradle came from the house, and the croon of a
soft lullaby to a wailing child. The stars glowed in the
narrow glimpse of sky; against the walls the sea was
moaning. And in another spot a hero's heart suffered
while waiting for death.</p>

<p>"Life!" said Stelio, resuming his walk, and drawing
Daniele with him. "Here, at this moment, all that
trembles, weeps, hopes, breathes, and raves in the immensity
of life, gathers itself in your mind, condensing
itself there with a sublimation so rapid that you believe
yourself able to express it all in a single word. But
what word? What word? Do you know it? Who will
ever know it well enough to speak it?"</p>

<p>Again he was distressed at his inability to embrace
all and express all.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen, at certain times, the whole universe
standing before you, as distinct as a human head?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
I have, a thousand times. Ah, to cut it off, like him
that cut off Medusa's head, at one stroke, and hold it
up before the multitude so that it never should be forgotten!
Have you ever thought that a great tragedy
might resemble the attitude of Perseus? I tell you this:
I should like to take the bronze of Benvenuto Cellini
from the Loggia of Orcagna and place it in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foyer</i> of
the new theater as an admonition. But who will give
to a poet the sword of Hermes and the mirror of Athena?</p>

<p>"Perseus!" continued the Inspirer. "In the ravine,
below the citadel of Mycenæ, is a fountain called Perseia,
and it is the only living thing in that place where
all is parched and dead. Men are attracted toward it
as to a spring of life in that region where the melancholy
whiteness of the dried river-beds is visible late in the
twilight. All human thirst ardently approaches that
freshness. And throughout my work the music of that
stream shall be heard&mdash;the water, the melody of the
water. I have found it! In that, the pure element, shall
be accomplished the pure Act which is the aim of the
new tragedy. On its clear, cold waters shall sleep the
virgin destined to die 'deprived of nuptials,' like Antigone.
Do you understand? The pure Act marks the
defeat of antique Destiny. The new soul suddenly
breaks the iron band that held it, with a determination
born of madness, of a lucid delirium that resembles
ecstasy, or a deeper, clearer vision of Nature. In the
orchestra, the final ode is of the salvation and liberation
of man, obtained through pain and sacrifice. The
monstrous Fate is there, vanquished, near the tombs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the Atridæ, before the very corpses of the victims. Do
you understand? He that frees himself by means of
the pure Act, the brother that kills his sister to save
her soul from the horror that was about to seize her,
has himself in reality seen the face of Agamemnon!"</p>

<p>The fascination of the funereal gold had taken fresh
hold upon his fancy; the evidence of his internal vision
gave him a look as of one under a spell of hallucination.</p>

<p>"One of the corpses surpasses all the others in height
and in majesty: his brow is crowned with a golden diadem,
and he wears a cuirass, shoulder-plates, and a girdle
of gold, surrounded with swords, lances, daggers, cups,
and countless golden discs scattered like petals over
his body, more venerable than a demigod. The man
bends over this body, while it is vanishing in the light
before his very eyes, and lifts the heavy mask. Ah,
does he not then see the face of Agamemnon? Is not
this corpse perhaps the King of kings? The mouth and
the eyes are open. Do you remember that passage of
Homer's? 'As I lay dying, I raised my hands to my
sword; but the woman with dog-like eyes went away,
and would not close my eyes and my mouth, at the moment
when I was about to descend to the abode of
Hades.' Do you remember? Well, the mouth of this
corpse is open, and its eyes are open. He has a high brow,
ornamented with a single large golden leaf; the nose
is long and straight, the chin oval"&mdash;</p>

<p>The magician paused an instant, his eyes fixed and
dilated. He was a seer. All about him disappeared, and
his fiction remained the only reality. Daniele trembled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
for he too was able to see through the eyes of the other.</p>

<p>"Ah, the white spot on the shoulder, too! He has
raised the armor. The spot, the spot! the hereditary
mark of the race of Pelops 'of the ivory shoulder'! Is
he not indeed the King of kings?"</p>

<p id="id195">The rapid, half-broken utterances of the seer were like
a succession of flashes whereby he himself was dazzled.
He had astonished even himself by that sudden apparition,
that unexpected discovery which illumined the
shadows of his mind, because exterior reality, and almost
tangible. How had he been able to discover that spot
on Agamemnon's shoulder? From what abyss of his
memory had suddenly surged up that detail so strange,
yet precise and decisive as a mark that affords recognition
of a body dead since the preceding day?</p>

<p>"You were there!" exclaimed Daniele, intoxicated. "It
was you yourself that lifted that armor and that mask!
If you have really seen what you have just described,
you are no longer a man!"</p>

<p>"I have seen! I have seen!"</p>

<p>Again he became an actor in his own drama, and it
was with a violent palpitation that he heard, from the
lips of a living person, the words of the drama&mdash;the very
words that were to be spoken in the episode itself: "If
you have really seen what you have described, you are
no longer a man." From that instant, the explorer of
sepulchers took on the aspect of a noble hero fighting
against the ancient destiny that had risen from the ashes
of the Atridæ to contaminate and overthrow him.</p>

<p>"Not with impunity," he continued, "does a man open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
tombs and gaze upon the faces of the dead&mdash;and what
dead! He lives alone with his sister, the sweetest creature
that ever has breathed the air of earth&mdash;alone with
her, in the dwelling full of light and silence, as in a
prayer, a consecration. Now, imagine one that unconsciously
drinks poison, a philter, I know not what impure
thing, which poisons his blood and corrupts his
thoughts&mdash;suddenly, while his soul is at peace. Imagine
this terrible evil, this vengeance of the dead! He is
suddenly seized by an unholy passion; he becomes the
miserable, trembling prey of a monster; he fights a
desperate, secret fight, without truce, without mercy,
day and night, every hour, every moment&mdash;all the more
atrocious the more the innocent pity of the poor creature
inclines toward his evil. How can this man be freed?
From the very beginning of the tragedy, as soon as the
innocent one begins to speak, it is evident that she is
destined to die. And all that is said and done in the
episodes, all that is expressed by the music, and by the
songs and dances of the interludes, serves to lead her
slowly but inexorably toward death. She is the equal
of Antigone. In her brief, tragic hour, she passes accompanied
by the light of hope and the shadow of presentiment;
she passes accompanied by songs and tears,
by the noble love that offers joy, by the mad love
that engenders mourning; and she never pauses except
to fall asleep on the cold, clear waters of the
fountain that called to her from the solitudes with
its continual murmur. Hardly has her brother killed
her when he receives from her, through death, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
gift of his redemption. 'All stain,' he cries, 'is
effaced from my soul! I have become wholly pure!
All the sanctity of my former love has reëntered my soul
like a torrent of light. Were she here now, all my
thoughts of her would be pure as lilies. Were she to
rise again, she could walk over my heart as over immaculate
snow. Now she is perfect; now she can be
adored as a divinity. I will lay her in the deepest of
my sepulchers, and around her I will lay all my treasures.'
Thus, the act of death, into which he has been
drawn by his lucid madness, becomes an act of purification
and of liberation, marking the defeat of ancient
Destiny. Emerging from the symphonic ocean, the ode
shall sing of the victory of man, shall illumine the darkness
of the catastrophe with an unknown light, and shall
elevate to the summit of music the first word of the
Drama renewed."</p>

<p>"The gesture of Perseus!" exclaimed Daniele, still
under the spell of exaltation. "At the end of the tragedy
you cut off the head of the Moira, and show it to the
multitude, ever young and ever-new, which shall bring
the spectacle to a close amid great cries of enthusiasm."</p>

<p>Both saw, as in a dream, the marble theater on the
Janiculum, the multitude swayed by the idea of truth
and of beauty, the illimitable starry Roman sky; they
saw the frenzied multitude descending the slope of the
hill, bearing in their rude hearts the confused revelation
of poetry; they heard the clamor prolonging itself in
the darkness of the immortal city.</p>

<p>"And now good-by, Daniele," said the master, reminded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of his need to hasten, as if some one waited for
him or called him.</p>

<p>The eyes of the Tragic Muse remained immovable in
the depths of his dream, sightless, petrified in the divine
blindness of statues.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To the Palazzo Capello."</p>

<p>"Does La Foscarina know the thread of your work?"</p>

<p>"Vaguely."</p>

<p>"And what figure shall you give to her?"</p>

<p>"She shall be blind, having already passed into another
world, and gone beyond the life of this. She shall
see that which others do not see. Her feet shall be in
the shadows, but her head in the light of eternal truth.
The contrasts of the tragic hour shall reverberate in
the darkness of her soul, multiplying themselves there
like thunder among the deep circles of solitary rocks.
Like Tiresias, she shall comprehend everything, permitted
or forbidden, celestial and terrestrial, and she shall
know 'how hard it is to know when knowing is useless.'
Ah, I shall put marvelous words into her mouth, and
silences that shall give birth to infinite beauties."</p>

<p>"On the stage," said Glauro, "whether she speaks or
is silent, her power is almost more than human. She
reveals to us the existence in our own hearts of the most
secret evil and the most hidden hopes; by her enchantment,
our past becomes present; and, by the virtue of
her aspect, we recognize ourselves in the trials suffered
by others throughout time, as if the soul she reveals to
us were our own."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>They stopped on the Ponte Savio. Stelio was silent,
under a flood of love and melancholy, which had suddenly
come upon him.</p>

<p>"I wish I had not to leave you to-night, Stelio," confessed
the faithful brother, who was also invaded by a
peculiar melancholy. "When I am with you, I breathe
more freely, and live a swifter life."</p>

<p>Stelio was silent. The wind had abated somewhat.
The brown church and the square tower of naked brick
seemed to be praying silently to the stars.</p>

<p>"Do you know the green column that stands in San
Giacomo dall' Orio?" Daniele resumed, intending to
hold his friend a little longer, because he dreaded to say
farewell. "What sublimity! It is like the fossilized
condensation of an immense green forest. In following
its innumerable veins, the eye travels in a dream through
sylvan mysteries. When I look at it I fancy myself
visiting Sila and Ercinna."</p>

<p>Stelio knew the column. One day Perdita had leaned
long against the precious shaft, contemplating the magic
frieze of gold that curves above the canvas of Bassano,
obscuring it.</p>

<p>"To dream&mdash;always to dream," he sighed, with a return
of that bitter impatience which had suggested sneering
words to him when he had come on the boat from
the Lido. "To live on relics! Think of Dandolo, who
overthrew the column and an empire at the same time,
and who preferred to remain doge when he might have
become emperor. Perhaps he lived more than you, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
wander in fancy through forests when you examine the
marble he pillaged. Good-by, Daniele."</p>

<p>"I shall stop at the Palazzo Vendramin for news,"
said the faithful brother.</p>

<p>These words recalled afresh the thought of the great
ailing heart, the weight of the hero in their arms, the
terrible removal.</p>

<p>"He has conquered&mdash;he can die," said Stelio.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
SOFIA</h2>


<p>Stelio entered La Foscarina's house like a
spirit. His mental exaltation changed the aspect
of things. The hall, lighted by a galley
lamp, appeared immense to him. The detached
cabin of a gondola standing on the pavement near the
door, startled him as if he had suddenly seen a coffin.</p>

<p>"Ah, Stelio!" exclaimed the actress, rising with a start
and hastening toward him impetuously, with all the
spring of her eagerness that had been repressed by expectation.
"At last!"</p>

<p>She stopped before him suddenly, without touching
him. The swift impulse vibrated in her visibly. She
was like a wind when it falls. "Who has detained you
from me?" was her thought, while her heart was filled
with doubt; for in one instant she had discerned something
about the beloved one that rendered him intangible
to her&mdash;something strange and far-away in his eyes.</p>

<p>But he had found her most beautiful at the very moment
when she sprang from the shadows, animated by
a violence like that of the tempest sweeping the lagoons.
The cry, the gesture, the sudden halt, the vibration of
her body, the light in her countenance suddenly extinguished
like a fire fallen to ashes, the intensity of her
gaze, like the glow of battle, the breath that parted her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
lips as heat breaks open the lips of the earth&mdash;all these
aspects of her real self showed a capability of pathos
comparable only to the effervescence of natural energies,
the power of cosmic force. The artist recognized in
her the Dionysian creature, the living material, apt for
receiving the rhythms of art, to be modeled according
to poetic forms. And, because he saw her character as
varying as the waves of the sea, he found inert the blind
mask he thought to put on her face; the tragic fable
through which she was to pass in sadness seemed narrow,
and too limited was the order of sentiment whence
she should draw her expressions, almost subterranean
the soul she must reveal. His mental images were
seized with a sort of panic, a fleeting terror. What could
be that single work in the immensity of life? Æschylus
composed more than a hundred tragedies, Sophocles still
more. They had constructed a world with gigantic fragments
lifted by their titanic arms. Their labor was as
vast as a cosmogony. The Æschylian figures seemed
still warm with ethereal life, shining with sidereal light,
humid from the fertilizing cloud. The spirit of the Earth
worked in the creators.</p>

<p>"Hide me, hide me! Do not ask me anything, and
let me be silent!" he implored, incapable of concealing
his perturbation, powerless to control the tumult of his
disordered thoughts.</p>

<p>The woman's heart beat fast in the ignorance of fear.</p>

<p>"Why? What have you done?"</p>

<p>"I suffer."</p>

<p>"From what?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anxiety, anxiety&mdash;from that trouble of mine which
you know well."</p>

<p>She clasped him in her arms. He felt that she was
trembling in doubt.</p>

<p>"Are you mine&mdash;are you still mine?" she asked, in a
stifled voice, her lips pressed to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;always yours."</p>

<p>This woman always suffered a horrible fear every time
she saw him depart from her, every time she saw him
return. When he went, was it not toward the unknown
betrothed? When he returned, was it not to bid her
a last farewell?</p>

<p>She clasped him in her arms with the fondness of a
lover, a sister, a mother&mdash;with all human love.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you? Tell me!"</p>

<p>A continual need tormented her to offer, to serve, to
obey a command that urged her toward peril, toward
a struggle to seize some good that she might bring to
him.</p>

<p>"What can I give you?"</p>

<p>He smiled wearily, overcome by sudden languor.</p>

<p>"What do you wish? Ah, I know!"</p>

<p>He smiled again, allowing himself to be caressed by
that voice, by those adoring hands.</p>

<p>"You wish for everything, do you not? You desire
everything?"</p>

<p>Still he smiled sadly, like an ailing child listening to
descriptions of delightful games.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I only could! But no one in the world can
give you anything of any value, dearest friend. Your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
poetry and your music&mdash;they alone can demand everything.
I remember that ode of yours beginning 'I was
Pan.'"</p>

<p>He leaned against the faithful heart his head now
filled with the light of beautiful thoughts.</p>

<p>"'I was Pan.'"</p>

<p>Through his spirit passed the splendor of that lyrical
moment, the delirium of that ode.</p>

<p>"Have you seen your sea to-day? Did you see the
storm?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, without speaking.</p>

<p>"Was it a great storm? One day you told me that
you have many mariners among your forefathers. Have
you been thinking to-day of your home on the dunes?
Are you homesick for the sand? Do you wish to go
back there? You have worked a great deal there, and
have done great work. It is a consecrated house. Your
mother was with you while you worked. You could
hear her stepping softly in the next room. Sometimes
she stopped to listen, did she not?"</p>

<p>He embraced her silently. That voice penetrated his
very soul, and refreshed it.</p>

<p>"And your sister was with you, too? You told me her
name once, and I have not forgotten it. She is called
Sofia. I know that she is like you. I should like to
hear her speak once, or to watch her walking along the
road. Once you praised her hands. They are beautiful,
are they not? You told me one day that when she
is sad her hands hurt her, as if they were the roots of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
her soul. That is what you said&mdash;'the roots of her
soul.'"</p>

<p>He listened, almost happy. How had she discovered
the secret of soothing him, the balm for his soul? From
what hidden spring did she draw the fluid melody of
those memories?</p>

<p>"Sofia never will know the good she has done to the
poor traveler. I know little of Sofia herself, but I know
that she resembles you, and I have often pictured her
to myself. I can see her at this moment. When I have
been in distant countries, far-away among strangers,
feeling almost lost, she has appeared to me often, and
borne me company. She has appeared to me suddenly,
when I had neither called nor expected her. Once I
saw her at Mürren, where I had arrived after a long,
weary journey, made in order to see a poor friend who
was at the point of death. Day was breaking; the
mountains had that cold, delicate color of beryl that is
seen only among glaciers. Why did she come? We
waited, together. The sun touched the summits of the
mountains. Then a brilliant rainbow crowned them for
a moment, then vanished. And Sofia vanished with the
rainbow, with the miracle."</p>

<p>He listened, almost happy. Were not all the beauty
and all the truth that he himself would like to express
contained in a stone, or in a flower of those mountains?
The most tragic struggle of human passions was not
worth the apparition of that mystic light upon the
eternal snows.</p>

<p>"And another time?" he asked softly, for the pause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
was long, and he feared that she would not continue.
She smiled, then looked sad.</p>

<p>"Another time I was at Alexandria in Egypt, in a
time of confused horror, as if after a shipwreck. The
city had an aspect of putrefaction, like a city in decay.
I remember: a street full of muddy water; a white horse,
thin as a skeleton, that splashed in the water, its mane
and tail of an ochre color; the turrets of an Arabian
cemetery, the far-away gleam of the marsh of Mareotis.
What misery! What disgust!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear soul, never, never again shall you be left
alone and despairing," said Stelio in his heart, now filled
with fraternal tenderness for the nomad woman who
recalled the sadness of her continual wanderings.</p>

<p>"And another time?" he said aloud.</p>

<p>"Another time it was in Vienna, in a museum. There
was a great, empty hall, the rain whipped against the
windows; innumerable precious relics were there in crystal
cases; the signs of death were everywhere, exiled
things no longer prayed to or adored. Together Sofia
and I leaned over a case containing a collection of holy
arms, with their metal hands fixed in an immovable
gesture. There were martyr's hands sown with agates,
amethysts, topaz, garnets, and pale turquoises. Through
certain openings, splinters of bone were visible. One
hand held a golden lily, another a miniature city, another
clasped a column. One was smaller than the
others; it had a ring on every finger, and held a vase
full of ointment: the relics of Mary Magdalene. Exiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
things, become profane, no longer prayed to or adored.
Is Sofia devout? Has she the habit of prayer?"</p>

<p>He did not reply. He felt that he should not speak,
nor give any visible sign of his own life in the enchantment
of that distant life.</p>

<p>"Sometimes your sister used to enter your room while
you were at work, and lay a blade of grass on the page
newly begun."</p>

<p>The enchantress trembled; a veiled image seemed to
be suddenly revealing itself.&mdash;Do you know that I began
to love her&mdash;the girl that sings, the girl whom you
cannot have forgotten&mdash;because I thought of your sister?
Yes&mdash;in order to pour into a pure soul the tenderness
my soul wished to offer to your sister, from whom so
many cruel things separated me! Do you know that?&mdash;</p>

<p>Those words quivered with life, but they were not
spoken; yet the voice trembled at their mute presence.</p>

<p>"Then you would grant yourself a few moments of
rest. You went to the window with her, and both gazed
out upon the sea. A plowman drove his young oxen
over the sand to teach them a straight furrow. When
they were finally taught, they no longer plowed the
sand, but went up on the hill. Who has told me these
things?"</p>

<p>He himself had told her once, almost in the same
words, but now these memories came back like unexpected
visions.</p>

<p>"Then flocks of sheep passed along the shore; they
came from the mountains, and were on the way to the
plains of the Puglia. All was still; a golden silence covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the shore. Later, you went with your sister, and
followed the tracks left by the sheep along the wet
sand.... Who has told me all these things?"</p>

<p>Stelio's fevered mind was calmed. A slow peace, like
slumber, descended upon him.</p>

<p>"Then sudden storms sprang up; the sea sometimes
overflowed the dunes and the land, leaving foam on
juniper and tamarisk trees, on myrtle and rosemary.
Heaps of seaweed and jetsam would be thrown on the
beach. A boat had been wrecked somewhere. The sea
brought firewood to the poor, and mourning to heaven
knows whom! The beach would be thronged with
people, each trying to collect the largest bundle of wood.
Then your sister would bring other aid&mdash;bread, wine,
vegetables, linen. Blessings would rise louder than the
noise of the waves. You looked out of the window, and
thought that none of your beautiful images was worth
the odor of warm bread. You left the half-finished page,
and hurried to help Sofia, speaking to the women, the
children and the old men.... Who has told me all
these things?"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
A BROTHER TO ORPHEUS</h2>


<p>From that first evening, Stelio had preferred to
go to the house of his beloved through the
gate of the Gradenigo garden, making his way
through trees and shrubs that had become wild
again. The actress had received permission to open a
communication between her own garden and that of
the long-abandoned palace by means of an opening in
the dividing wall. But soon afterward, the Lady Myrta
had come to live in the great silent rooms wherein the
last guest had been the son of the Empress Josephine,
the Viceroy of Italy. The apartments were ornamented
with old, stringless musical instruments, and the garden
was peopled by graceful hounds, that lacked any prey.</p>

<p>To Stelio, nothing seemed sweeter or more sad than
that walk toward the woman that waited for him while
counting the hours&mdash;so slow, yet so swift in their flight.
In the afternoon, the path of San Simeone Piccolo turned
a pale golden hue, like a bank of the finest alabaster.
The reflected rays of sunlight danced on the iron prows
that stood in a row by the pier. A few decaying gondola
cabins lay in the shadow of the pavements, with
their curtains and cushions stained and spoiled by rain,
as if they were catafalques worn out by continual use
in funeral ceremonies, grown old on the way to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
churchyard. The garden gate opened at the end of the
Campiello della Comare, green and mossy like a country
cemetery; it spread out between two columns, topped
by broken statues, on the limbs of which the dry
branches of ivy were outlined like veins.</p>

<p>"Helion! Sirius! Altair! Donovan! Ali-Nour! Nerissa!
Piuchebella!"</p>

<p>Seated on a bench near a rose-covered wall, Lady
Myrta was calling her dogs. La Foscarina stood near
her, in a fawn-colored costume, the material of which
resembled that superb textile called <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rovana</i>, used in
ancient times in Venice. The sunlight bathed the
women and the roses in the same soft warmth.</p>

<p>"You are dressed like Donovan to-day," said Lady
Myrta to the actress, with a smile. "Did you know
that Stelio prefers Donovan to all the others?"</p>

<p>A slight blush rose to La Foscarina's cheeks; she
looked at the fawn-colored greyhound.</p>

<p>"He is the strongest and the most beautiful," she
replied.</p>

<p>"I believe that Stelio would like to have him," added
the old lady, with a sweet, indulgent smile.</p>

<p>"What is there that he would not like to have?"</p>

<p>Lady Myrta noted the tinge of melancholy in the tone
of the woman in love. She remained silent.</p>

<p>The dogs lay near them, serious and sad, sleepy and
dreamy, far from plains, steppes, and deserts, stretched
out in the clover, where also grew the gourds, with
their greenish-yellow fruit.</p>

<p>"Does your lover grieve you?" the elder woman would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
have liked to ask of the woman in love, for the silence
weighed on her, and she felt her own heart revivified by
the fire within that sorrowful soul. But she dared not.
She only sighed. Her heart, ever young, still throbbed
at the sight of despairing passion and beauty menaced.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are still beautiful, and your lips still attract
kisses, and the man that loves you can still be intoxicated
with your sweet pallor and your eyes," she thought, as
she looked at the pensive actress, toward whom the November
roses leaned. "But I am a specter."</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes, gazed upon her own deformed
hands lying on her lap, and wondered that those hands
were hers, they were so dead and distorted, lamentable
monsters that could no longer touch anyone without
exciting disgust, that had nothing to caress any more
except the dogs. She felt the wrinkles in her face, the
false teeth against her gums, the false hair on her head,
all the ruin of her poor body, which once was obedient
to the graceful will of her delicate spirit; and she wondered
at her own persistence in struggling against the
outrages of Time, in deceiving herself, in recomposing
every morning that ridiculous illusion with essences, oils,
unguents, rouge and powder. But, in the perpetual
springtime of her dreams, was she not ever youthful?
Was it not yesterday, only yesterday, that she had caressed
a loved face with her perfect fingers, hunted the
fox and the deer in the northern counties, danced with
her betrothed in the park to an air of John Dowland's?&mdash;There
are no mirrors in the house of the Countess
Glanegg; there are too many in Lady Myrta's house&mdash;was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
La Foscarina's thought.&mdash;One has hidden her decline
from herself and from everyone else; the other sees herself
growing older day by day. She counts her wrinkles
one by one, gathers up her dead hair in her comb, feels
her teeth rattling against her pale gums, and tries to
repair the damage by artificial devices. Poor tender
soul, who wishes still to be smiling and charming! But
we must die, disappear, descend into the earth!&mdash;She
observed the little cluster of violets that Lady Myrta
had pinned to her skirt. In all seasons fresh flowers
were fastened there, barely visible, hidden among the
folds, a sign of her daily illusion of springtime, of the
ever-new enchantment she wove about herself by the
aid of memory, music, poetry, and all the arts of dreams
against old age, infirmity, and solitude.&mdash;We should live
one supreme, flaming hour, then disappear forever in
the earth before all charm has vanished, before all grace
is dead!&mdash;</p>

<p>She felt the beauty of her own eyes, the careless
strength of her hair, blown back by the wind, all the
power of rhythm and transport that slumbered in her
muscles and her bones. She heard again in fancy the
words of her lover, saw him again in his tender transport
of love, in the sweetness of languor, the moments
of profound oblivion.&mdash;Still a little while, still a few days
longer I shall please him, and seem beautiful to him,
and put fire in his blood. A little while longer!&mdash;With
her feet in the deep grass, her brow raised to the sunlight,
amid the fragrance of fading roses, in the fawn-colored
robe that made her seem like the magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
beast of prey, she glowed with passionate joy of life and
hope, a sudden quickening of the blood, as if that future
which she had renounced by her resolution to die were
flowing back into the present.&mdash;Come! come!&mdash;Within
herself she called to her beloved with a sort of intoxication,
sure that he would come, because she already felt
that he would, and never had she been deceived by her
presentiment.</p>

<p>"Ah, here is Stelio!" said Lady Myrta at that instant,
seeing the young man advancing among the laurels.</p>

<p>La Foscarina turned swiftly, with a blush. The greyhounds
rose, pricking up their slender ears. The meeting
glance of those lovers had something in it like an
electric flash. Again, as always, in the presence of that
wonderful creature, her lover had the divine sensation
of suddenly being enfolded in a cloud of flaming ether,
in a vibrant wave that seemed to isolate him from ordinary
atmosphere and almost to ravish his senses.</p>

<p>"You were awaited here by all that dwell in this
seclusion," said Lady Myrta, with a smile that hid the
emotion that stirred the youthful heart in the infirm and
aged body at the sight of love and longing. "In coming
here, you have responded to a call."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the young man, holding the collar
of Donovan, which, remembering his caresses, had run
to meet him. "The fact is, I have come a long distance.
Guess from where?"</p>

<p>"From the country of Giorgione!"</p>

<p>"No, from the cloister of Santa Apollonia. Do you
know that place?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that one of your inventions to-day?"</p>

<p>"Invention? It is a cloister of stone, a real cloister,
with a well and with little columns."</p>

<p>"It may be so, but everything that you have once
looked at, Stelio, becomes your invention."</p>

<p>"Ah, Lady Myrta, I should like to offer you that gem
of a cloister. I wish I might move it here, into your
garden. Imagine a small, secret cloister, opening on
a sequence of slender columns, set in pairs like nuns
when they walk, fasting, in the sun; very delicate,
neither white, gray nor black, but that most mysterious
tint ever given to stone by the great master colorist&mdash;Time.
In the midst of these is a well, and on the curb,
which is worn by the rope, hangs a pail without a bottom.
The nuns have disappeared, but I believe that the
shades of the Danaïdes frequent the place."</p>

<p>He stopped speaking suddenly, seeing himself surrounded
by the greyhounds, and began to imitate the
guttural sounds the kennel-men make to gather the
dogs. The animals became excited; their wistful eyes
brightened.</p>

<p>"Ali-Nour! Crissa! Nerissa! Clarissa! Altair! Helion!
Hardicanute! Veronese! Hierro!"</p>

<p>He knew them all by name, and when he called them
they seemed to recognize him for their master. There
was the Scottish hound, native of the highlands, with
thick, rough coat; the Irish wolf-hound, ruddy and
strong, with brown irises showing clearly in their whites;
the Tartary hound, spotted with black and yellow, a native
of vast Asiatic steppes, where at night he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
guarded a tent against hyenas and leopards; the Persian
dog, light-colored and small, with ears covered with long
silky hair, a fluffy tail, of lighter tint on the sides and
legs, more graceful than the antelopes he had killed;
there was also the Spanish <em>galgo</em> that had migrated with
the Moors, that magnificent animal held in leash by a
pompous dwarf in the painting by Velásquez, instructed
to course and to force on the naked plains of the Mancha;
the Arabian <em>sloughi</em>, illustrious depredator of the desert,
with black tongue and palate, a noble animal, all pride,
courage, and elegance, accustomed to sleep on rich rugs
and to lap pure milk from a pure vase. Assembled in a
pack, they quivered around him who knew how to reawaken
in their torpid blood their primitive instincts of
pursuit and carnage.</p>

<p>"Which among you was Gog's best friend?" he asked,
looking from one to another of the pairs of beautiful,
eager eyes fixed upon him. "You, Hierro? You, Altair?"</p>

<p>His peculiar accent animated the sensitive creatures,
which listened with suppressed and intermittent growls.</p>

<p>"Well, I must tell you all something that I have kept
secret till to-day. Gog&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;who could crush
a hare with one snap of his jaws&mdash;Gog is crippled."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed Lady Myrta, concerned. "Is
it possible, Stelio? And Magog&mdash;how is he?"</p>

<p>"Magog is safe and well."</p>

<p>These were the names of a pair of greyhounds that
Lady Myrta had given to the young man.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Alas, poor Gog! He had already killed thirty-seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
hares. He possessed all the virtues of his fine breed:
swiftness, resistance, incredible rapidity in turning, and
the constant desire to kill his prey, besides the classical
manner of running straight and seizing his prey from
behind almost at the same instant. Have you ever
watched a greyhound in coursing, Foscarina?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Then you never have seen one of the rarest spectacles
of daring, vehemence, and grace in the world. Look!"</p>

<p>He drew Donovan toward him, knelt beside him, and
began feeling the animal with his expert hands.</p>

<p>"No machine in nature exists that is more exactly
and powerfully adapted to its purpose. The muzzle is
sharp in order to penetrate the air; it is long, so that
the jaws can crush the prey at the first snap. The skull
is wide between the ears in order to contain the greatest
courage and skill. The jowls are dry and muscular, and
the lips so short they hardly cover the teeth."</p>

<p>With sure and easy touch, he opened the mouth of
the dog, which offered no resistance.</p>

<p>"Look at those white teeth! See how long the eyeteeth
are, with a little curve at the top, the better to
hold his prey. No other species of dog has a mouth so
well constructed for biting."</p>

<p>His hands lingered over the examination, and his admiration
for the superb specimen was unbounded. He
was kneeling in the clover, and received in his face the
breath of the dog, which quietly permitted him to examine
it, as if it comprehended and enjoyed the praise
of the connoisseur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"See what elegance in his ribs, arranged with the symmetry
of a fine keel, and in that line curved inward toward
the abdomen, which is hidden. All point to one
aim. The tail, thick at the root and slender at the tip&mdash;look!
almost like that of a rat&mdash;serves as a sort of
rudder, necessary to enable him to turn swiftly when the
hare doubles. Let us see, Donovan, whether you are
perfect also in this respect."</p>

<p>He took the tip of the tail, passed it under the leg,
and drew it toward the haunch-bone, where it exactly
touched the projecting part.</p>

<p>"Yes, perfect! Once I saw an Arab of the tribe of
Arbâa measuring his <em>sloughi</em> in that way. Ali-Nour, did
you tremble when you discovered the herd of gazelles?
Imagine, Foscarina&mdash;the <em>sloughi</em> trembles when he discovers
his prey, quivers like a willow, and turns his
soft, pleading eyes toward his master, begging to be
released. I do not know the reason why this pleases
me and stirs me so much. His desire to kill is terrible;
his whole body is ready to stretch itself like a bow, yet
he trembles! Not with fear, nor with uncertainty, but
with sheer desire. Ah, Foscarina! if you could see a
<em>sloughi</em> at that moment, you would not fail to learn from
him his manner of quivering, and you would render the
manner human by the power of your tragic art, and
would give mankind a new sensation. Up, Ali-Nour!
swift desert arrow! Do you remember? But now you
tremble only when you are cold."</p>

<p>Blithe and graceful, he had let Donovan go, and had
taken between his hands the serpentine head of the slayer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of gazelles; he gazed into those deep eyes, wherein lurked
nostalgia for the silent, tropical land; for tents unfolded
after a march toward some deceiving mirage; for fires
kindled for the evening meal under stars that seemed to
throb in the waves of the wind just above the summits
of the palm-trees.</p>

<p>La Foscarina had entered into that physical enchantment
of love whereby the limits of one's being seem to
dilate and be fused in the air, so that every word and
movement of the beloved object brings a feeling of happiness
sweeter than any caress. Her lover had taken
between his hands the head of Ali-Nour, but she felt
the touch of those hands upon her own brow. He was
gazing into Ali-Nour's eyes, but she could feel that gaze
deep in her own soul.</p>

<p>Had he not touched the obscurest mystery of her being?
Did he not compel her to feel within herself the
animal depths whence had sprung the unexpected revelation
of her tragic genius, moving and maddening the
multitude as would a splendid spectacle of sea and sky,
a gorgeous sunrise, a tremendous tempest. When he had
spoken of the trembling <em>sloughi</em>, had he not divined the
natural analogies whence she drew the power of expression
that amazed peoples and poets? It was because
she had re-discovered the Dionysian sense of Nature
as a naturalizer, the antique fervor of instinctive and
creative energies, the enthusiasm of the multiform god
emerging from the fermentation of all sap, that she appeared
so new and so great on the stage. Sometimes
she felt within herself something like an immanence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the miracle which in the mystic past swelled with divine
milk the breasts of the Mænads at the approach of the
hungry young panthers.</p>

<p>Stelio began again to imitate the guttural call of the
kennel-keeper. The dogs grew more excited; their eyes
brightened again; the tense muscles swelled under the
coats&mdash;tawny, black, white, gray, spotted; the long
haunches were curved like bows ready to hurl into
space those bodies dry and slender, like a quiver-full
of arrows.</p>

<p>"There, Donovan, there!"</p>

<p>Stelio pointed to a reddish-gray object in the grass
at the end of the garden; it looked somewhat like a
crouching hare with flattened ears. The imperious voice
deceived the hesitating hounds, and it was beautiful to
see the slender, vigorous bodies quivering in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"There, Donovan!"</p>

<p>The great tawny dog looked him deep in the eyes,
gave a formidable bound toward the imaginary prey,
with all the vehemence of his reawakened instinct. He
reached the spot in an instant, then stopped, disappointed,
followed by the whole pack.</p>

<p>"A gourd! a gourd!" cried the deceiver, with shouts
of laughter. "Not even a rabbit. Poor Donovan! He
bit only a gourd! Poor Donovan! what humiliation!
Take care, Lady Myrta, lest he drown himself in the
canal for very shame!"</p>

<p>From the contagion of her lover's gayety, La Foscarina
laughed too. Her fawn-tinted gown and the tan coats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of the hounds shone in the sunlight against the green
clover. Her white teeth, revealed by rippling laughter,
graced her mouth with a renewal of youth.</p>

<p>"Would you like to own Donovan?" said Lady Myrta,
with a touch of graceful, malicious significance. "I
know your arts!"</p>

<p>Stelio ceased laughing, and blushed like a boy.</p>

<p>A wave of tenderness filled La Foscarina's heart as
she saw the boyish blush. She fairly sparkled with love;
she felt a wild wish to clasp him in her arms at that
very moment.</p>

<p>Before thanking Lady Myrta, Stelio looked again at
the dog, admiring him as he was, strong, splendid, perfect,
with the mark of style on his limbs as if Pisanello
had drawn him for the reverse of a medal. Then he
looked at La Foscarina, who had turned to the group of
animals, moving over the grass with a swift undulation,
like the movement called the greyhound step by the
ancient Venetians. She advanced, with Donovan, holding
him by the collar. The chill of evening began to
be felt, the shadow of the bronze cupola grew longer on
the grass; a purple mist, in which the last flecks of
golden sunlight swam, began to spread over the branches
that swayed in the breeze.</p>

<p>&mdash;See, we are yours!&mdash;the woman seemed to be saying
mutely, while the animal, beginning to shiver, pressed
close against her.&mdash;We are yours forever. We are here
to serve you!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
ONLY ONE CONDITION</h2>


<p>Heartrending was the sweetness of that November,
smiling like a sick person who fancies
himself to have reached a state of convalescence
and feels an unusual sense of relief and
well-being, knowing not that his hour of agony draws
near.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you to-day, Fosca? What
has happened to you? Why are you so distant to me?
Speak! Tell me!"</p>

<p>Stelio had entered San Marco by chance, and had seen
her there, leaning against the chapel-door that leads to
the baptistry. She was alone, motionless, her face devoured
by fever and by shadows, with terrified eyes fixed
on the fearful figures of the mosaics that flamed in a
yellow fire.</p>

<p>"Leave me here alone, I entreat you&mdash;I beg of you!
I must be alone! I implore you!"</p>

<p>She turned as if to flee, but he detained her.</p>

<p>"But tell me! Speak at least one word that I may
understand."</p>

<p>Still she sought to escape, and her movement expressed
unspeakable anguish.</p>

<p>"I implore you! If you pity me, the only thing you
can do for me now is to let me go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"But one word&mdash;at least one word, so that I shall
understand."</p>

<p>A flash of fury passed over the agitated face.</p>

<p>"No! I wish to be alone!"</p>

<p>Her voice was as hard as her glance. She turned,
taking a step or two like a person overcome by dizziness
seeking some support.</p>

<p>"Foscarina!"</p>

<p>But he dared not detain her longer. He saw the despairing
one walk through the zone of sunlight that
invaded the basilica like a rushing torrent entering
through a door opened by an unknown hand. Behind
her the deep golden cavern, with its apostles, martyrs,
and sacred beasts, glittered as if the thousand torches
of the daylight were pouring in on it.</p>

<p>"I am lost in the depths of sadness.... This violent
impulse to revolt against fate, to rush away in search of
adventure&mdash;to seek.&mdash;Who will save my hope? Whence
will come a ray of light?... To sing, to sing! But
I would sing a song of life at last.... Can you tell
me where the Lord of the Flame is at present?"</p>

<p>These words, in a letter from Donatella Arvale, were
branded on her eyes and on her soul, with all the characteristics
of handwriting, as much alive as the hand
that traced them, as throbbing as that impatient pulse.
She saw them graved on the stones, outlined on the
clouds, reflected in the water, indelible and inevitable
as the decrees of Fate.</p>

<p>&mdash;Where shall I go? Where shall I go?&mdash;Through all
her agitation and despair, she had still a sense of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
sweetness of things, the warmth of the gilded marbles,
the perfume of the quiet air, the languor of human
leisure.</p>

<p>She turned with a start, fearing yet hoping to be followed
by her lover. She could not see him. She would
have fled had she seen him, but her heart ached as if
he had sent her to death without a word of recall.&mdash;All
is over!&mdash;</p>

<p>She entered the Porta della Carta, having crossed the
threshold. The intoxication of her sorrow led her to
the spot where, on a night of glory, the three destinies
had come together. She went to the well, the point of
that rendezvous. Around that bronze curb the whole
life of those few seconds rose again with the distinct
outline of reality. There she had said, addressing her
companion with a smile: "Donatella, this is the Lord
of the Flame!" Then the immense cry of the multitude
had drowned her voice, and above their head rose a
flight of fiery pigeons against the dark sky.</p>

<p>She approached the well, and gazed into it. She
leaned over the curb, saw her own face in the deep mirror,
saw in it terror and perdition, saw the motionless
Medusa she carried in the depth of her soul. Without
realizing it, she repeated the action of him she loved.
She saw his face, too, and Donatella's, as she had seen
them illumined for an instant that night, close together,
lighted by the radiance in the sky.</p>

<p>&mdash;Love, love each other! I will go away, I shall disappear!
Good-by!&mdash;</p>

<p>She closed her eyes at the thought of death, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that darkness she saw the kind, strong eyes of her
mother, infinite as a horizon of peace.&mdash;You are at
peace, and you await me&mdash;you whose life and death were
of passion.&mdash;</p>

<p>She stood erect, then departed by the Molo, stepped
into a gondola, and ordered it to be rowed to the
Giudecca. The buildings and the water formed a
miracle of gold and opal. The image of dead Summer
flashed across her memory&mdash;dead Summer dressed in
gold and shut in a coffin of opalescent glass. She imagined
herself submerged in the lagoon, sleeping on a bed
of seaweed; but the memory of the promise made on
that water, and kept in the delirium of that night, pierced
her heart like a knife, and threw her into a convulsion.</p>

<p>&mdash;Never more, then? Never more!&mdash;</p>

<p>She reached the Rio della Croce. The gondola stopped
before a closed door. She landed, took out a small key,
opened the door, and entered the garden.</p>

<p>This was her refuge, the secret place for her solitude,
defended by the fidelity of her melancholy as by silent
guardians.</p>

<p>"Never more?" She walked under the trellises, approached
the water, stopped a moment, felt weary, and
at last sat down on a stone, held her temples between
her hands, and made an effort to concentrate her mind,
to recover her self-possession. "He is still here, near
me. I can see him again. Perhaps I shall find him
standing on the steps of my house. He will take me in
his arms, kiss my lips and eyes, tell me again that he
loves me, that everything about me pleases him. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
does not know&mdash;he does not understand. Nothing irreparable
has happened. What is it, then, that has so
upset and disturbed me? I have received a letter written
by a girl who is far-away, imprisoned in a lonely
villa near her demented father, who complains of her
lot and seeks to change it. That is all. There is no
more to say. And here is the letter."</p>

<p>Her fingers trembled, and she fancied she could detect
Donatella's favorite perfume, as if the young girl
were sitting beside her.</p>

<p>&mdash;Is she beautiful? Really beautiful? How does she
look?&mdash;</p>

<p>The lines of the image were indistinct at first. She
tried to seize them, but they eluded her. One particular
above all others fixed itself in her mind&mdash;the large, massive
hand.&mdash;Did he see her hand that night? He is very
susceptible to the beauty of hands. When he meets a
woman, he always looks at her hands. And he adores
Sofia's hands.&mdash;She allowed herself to dwell on these
childish considerations, then she smiled bitterly. And
suddenly the image became perfect, lived, glowing with
youth and power, overwhelmed and dazzled her.&mdash;Yes,
she is beautiful! And hers is the beauty he desires.&mdash;</p>

<p>She kept her eyes fixed on the silent splendor of the
waters, with the letter on her lap; she was nailed there
by the inflexible truth. And involuntary thoughts of
destruction flashed upon her inert discouragement; the
face of Donatella burned by fire, her body crippled by
a fall, her voice ruined by an illness! Then she had a
horror of herself, followed by pity for herself and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
other woman.&mdash;Has she not too the right to live? Let
her live, let her love, let her have her joy.&mdash;She imagined
for the young girl some magnificent adventure, a happy
love, an adorable betrothed, prosperity, luxury, pleasure.&mdash;Is
there only one man on this earth, then, that
she can love? Is it impossible that to-morrow she might
meet some one who would win her heart? Is it impossible
that her fate should suddenly turn her in another
direction, take her far from here, lead her through unknown
paths, separate her from us forever? Is it necessary
that she should be loved by the man I love? Perhaps
they never will meet again.&mdash;She tried thus to escape
her presentiment. But a contrary thought whispered:
"They have met once; they will seek each other,
they will meet again. Her soul is not obscure&mdash;not one
that can be lost in the multitude. She possesses a gift
that shines like a star, and it will always be easily recognizable
even from afar&mdash;her song. The marvel of her
voice will serve her as a signal. She will surely avail
herself of this power; she too will pass among mankind
leaving a wake of admiration behind her. She will have
glory as she has beauty&mdash;two attributes that will easily
attract Stelio. They have met once; they will meet
again."</p>

<p>The sorrowing woman bent as if under a yoke. A
clear, pearly light bathed the lagoon in radiance. The
islands of La Follia, San Clemente, and San Servilio
were enveloped in a light mist. From a distance came
at intervals a faint cry, as of shipwrecked sailors becalmed,
answered by the harsh voice of a siren whistle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
or by the raucous call of the sea-gulls. At first the
silence seemed terrible, then it grew sweet.</p>

<p>The woman, little by little, recovered her deep goodness
of heart, felt again her old tenderness for the beautiful
creature in whose personality she had once deceived
her desire to love the good sister, Sofia. She thought
again of the hours passed in the lonely villa on that
hill of Settignano, where Lorenzo Arvale created his
statues in the fulness of his strength and fervor, ignorant
of the blow that was about to fall. She lived again
in those days, saw again those places; she sat once more
in memory for the famous sculptor who modeled her in
clay, while Donatella sang some quaint old song; and
the spirit of melody animated at once the model and the
effigy, and her thoughts and that pure voice and the
mystery of Art composed an appearance of a life almost
divine in that great studio open on all sides to the light
of heaven, whence Florence and its river was visible
in the springtime valley.</p>

<p>In addition to fancying the girl a reflection of Sofia,
had she not been attracted otherwise to her&mdash;the sweet
Donatella, who never had known a mother's caress since
her birth? She saw her again, grave and calm beside her
father, the comfort for his hard work, guardian of the
sacred flame, and also of a resolve of her own&mdash;a secret
resolve, which preserved itself as bright and keen as a
sword in its sheath.</p>

<p>&mdash;She is sure of herself; she is mistress of her own
power. When at last she knows she is free, she will reveal
herself as one made to rule. Yes, she is made to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
subjugate men, to excite their curiosity and their dreams.
Even now, her instinct, bold and prudent as experience
itself, directs her.&mdash;La Foscarina remembered Donatella's
attitude toward Stelio on that night; her almost disdainful
silence, her brief, dry words, her manner of leaving the
table, her disappearance, leaving the image of herself
framed within the circle of an unforgettable melody.
Ah, she knows the art of stirring the soul of a dreamer.
Certainly he cannot have forgotten her. And just as
certainly he awaits the hour when it shall be given him
to meet her again&mdash;not less impatiently than she, who
asks me where he is.&mdash;</p>

<p>Again she lifted the letter and ran her eyes over it,
but her memory traveled faster than her eyes. The
enigmatic query was at the foot of the page, like a half-veiled
postscript. Looking at the written words, she
felt again the same sharp pang as when she read them
the first time, and once more her heart was shaken as
if the danger were imminent, as if her passion and her
hope were already lost beyond recall.&mdash;What is she
about to do? Of what is she thinking? Did she expect
him to search for her without delay, and, disappointed
in that, does she now wish to tempt him? What
does she intend to do?&mdash;She struggled against that uncertainty
as against an iron door which she must force
in order to find again behind it the light of her life.&mdash;Shall
I answer her? Suppose I reply in such a way
as to make her understand the truth, would my love
necessarily be a prohibition of hers?&mdash;But here her soul
rose with a mingled feeling of repugnance, modesty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
pride.&mdash;No, never! Never shall she learn of my wound
from me&mdash;never, not even should she question me!&mdash;And
she realized all the horror of an open rivalry between a
woman no longer young and a girl strong in her maiden
youth. She felt the humiliation and cruelty of such an
unequal struggle. "But if not Donatella, would it not
be some one else," again whispered the contrary spirit
"Do you believe you can bind a man of his nature to
your melancholy passion? The only condition under
which you should have allowed yourself to love him,
and to offer him a love faithful unto death, was in keeping
the compact that you have broken."</p>

<p>"True, true!" she murmured, as if answering a distinct
voice, in formal judgment, pronounced in the silence
by invisible Fate.</p>

<p>"The only condition on which he can now accept your
love, and recognize it, demands that you leave him free,
that you give up all claim on him, that you renounce
all, forever, and ask for nothing&mdash;the condition of being
heroic. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"True, true!" she repeated aloud, raising her head.</p>

<p>But the poison bit her. She remembered all the sweetness
of caresses&mdash;the lips, the eyes, the strength and
ardor of the lover had re-animated all her being.</p>

<p>A far-away monotonous sound of song floated in the
air&mdash;a song of women's voices, that seemed to rise from
bosoms oppressed, from throats as slender as reeds, like
the sound evoked from the broken wires of old spinets
at a touch on the worn keys; a shrill, unequal tone, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a lively and vulgar rhythm, which sounded sadder in
that light and silence than the saddest things of life.</p>

<p>"Who is singing?"</p>

<p>With obscure emotion she arose, approached the shore,
and listened.</p>

<p>"The madwomen of San Clemente!"</p>

<p>From the isle of La Follia, from the barred windows
of the light, lonely hospital, came the lively yet melancholy
chorus. It trembled, hesitated in the immensity
of space, grew fainter and almost died away, then rose
again and swelled to a piercing shriek, diminished once
more, and finally sank to silence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
ILLUSIONS</h2>


<p>Yes, heart-rending was the sweetness of that November,
smiling like a sick person who has become
free from suffering, knowing it is the last,
and tasting again the sweetness of life, which
reveals to him new charms when just about to leave
him.</p>

<p>"Look at the Euganean hills below us, Foscarina; if
the wind should come they will rise and float in the air
like gauzy veils, and pass over our heads. I never have
seen them so transparent. Some day I should like to
go with you to Arquà; the villages there are as pink
as the shells we find in myriads in the earth. When we
arrive there, the first drops of a sudden shower will be
robbing the peach-blossoms of their petals. We will
wait under one of the arches of the Palladio to avoid
getting wet. Then, without inquiring the way of anyone,
we will look for the fountain of Petrarch. We will
carry with us his poems in the small edition of Misserini's,
that little book you keep beside your bed and cannot
close any more because it is so full of pressed leaves
and grasses. Would you like to go to Arquà some spring
day?"</p>

<p>She did not reply, but gazed silently at the lips that
said these graceful things; and, without hope, she simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
took a fugitive pleasure in their movement and accent.
For her there was in his image of the Spring the same
enchantment as in a stanza of Petrarch's; but she could
lay a bookmark in the one and find it again, while the
poetic fancies must be lost with the passing hour.</p>

<p>She wished to say: "I will not drink at that fountain,"
but kept silence, that she might still enjoy the
caress.&mdash;Oh, yes, intoxicate me with illusions! Play
your own game; do with me as you will.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here we are at San Giorgio in Alga. We shall reach
Fusina in a few minutes."</p>

<p>The little walled islet passed before them, with its
marble Madonna, perpetually admiring her reflection in
the water, like a nymph.</p>

<p>"Why are you so sweet, my beloved? I never have
seen you like this before. I know not where I am with
you to-day. I cannot find words to tell you with what
a sense of melody your presence inspires me. You are
here beside me, I can hold your hand, yet you are diffused
in the horizon, you yourself are the horizon, blended
with the waters, with the islands, with the hills. When
I was speaking just now, it seemed that each syllable
created in you infinitely dilating circles, like those round
that leaf just fallen from the gold-leaved tree. Is it true?
Tell me that it is. Oh, look at me!"</p>

<p>He felt himself enveloped in this woman's love as by
the air and the light; he breathed in that soul as in a
distinct element, receiving from it an ineffable fulness
of life as if a stream of mysterious things were flowing
from her and from the glory of the daylight at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
time, and pouring itself into his heart. The desire to
make some return for the happiness she gave him lifted
him to an almost religious height of gratitude, and suggested
to him words of thanks and of praise which he
would have spoken had he been kneeling before her in
the shadows. But the splendor of sky and sea around
them was so great that he could only be as silent as
she. And for both this was a moment of marvelous
communion in the light; it was a journey brief yet immense,
in which both traversed the dizzy distances they
had within themselves.</p>

<p>The boat reached the shore of Fusina. They roused
themselves, and gazed at each other with dazzled eyes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Does he love me, then?&mdash;</p>

<p>Hope and pain revived in the woman's heart. She
did not doubt the sincerity of her beloved, nor that his
words expressed the ardor of his heart. She knew how
absolutely he abandoned himself to every wave of emotion,
how incapable he was of deception or of falsehood.
More than once she had heard him utter cruel truths
with the same feline, flexible grace that some men adopt
when they wish to appear charming. She knew well the
direct, limpid gaze which sometimes became hard and icy,
but which never was otherwise than straight; but she
knew also the rapidity and marvelous diversity of emotion
and thought that rendered his spirit unseizable.
There was always in him something flexible and vigorous
that suggested to the actress the double and diverse
image of flame and of water. And it was this man she
wished to fix, to captivate, to possess! There was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in him an unlimited ardor of life, a sense of
<em>euphoria</em>, or joy in existence, as if every second were the
supreme instant, and he were about to tear himself from
the pleasure and pain of living, as from the tears and
embraces of a last farewell. And it was for this insatiable
avidity that she wished to remain the only
nourishment!</p>

<p>What was she to him, if not an aspect of that "life of
the thousand and thousand faces," toward which the
poet's desire, according to one of his own images, continually
shook all its thyrsi? For him she was a theme
for visions and inventions, like the hills, the woods, the
storms. He absorbed mystery and beauty from her as from
all forms of the universe. Even now he had withdrawn
his thoughts from her, and was occupied with a new
quest; his changeful, ingenuous eyes sought for some
miracle to marvel at and adore.</p>

<p>She looked at him, but he did not turn his face toward
her; he was studying the damp, foggy region
through which they were driving slowly. She sat beside
him, feeling herself deprived of her strength, no
longer capable of living in and for herself, of breathing
with her own breath, of following a thought that was unknown
to her beloved, hesitating even in her enjoyment
of natural objects that he had not pointed out.</p>

<p>Her life seemed to be alternately dissolving and condensing
itself. An instant of intensity would pass, and
then she waited for the next, and between them she
was conscious of nothing save that time was flying, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
lamp was flickering, the body was fading, and that all
things were perishing, dying.</p>

<p>"My dear, my friend," said Stelio, suddenly turning
and taking her hand, impelled by an emotion that had
overcome him, "why did we come to these places? They
seem very sweet, but they are full of terror."</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly.</p>

<p>"You suffer," he said, with a depth of pity in his tone
that made the woman turn pale. "Do you too feel this
terror?"</p>

<p>She looked around with the anxiety of one pursued,
and fancied she saw a thousand ominous phantoms rising
from the earth.</p>

<p>"Those statues!" said Stelio, in a tone that changed
them in her eyes into witnesses of her own wasting
life.</p>

<p>The country around them was as deserted and silent
as if its former inhabitants had been gone for centuries,
or were sleeping in graves new-made the day before.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to return? The boat is still there."</p>

<p>She seemed not to hear.</p>

<p>"Speak, Foscarina!"</p>

<p>"Let us go&mdash;let us go on," she replied. "Wherever
we may go our fate will not change."</p>

<p>Her body swayed to the slow, lulling roll of the
wheels, and she feared to interrupt it; she shrank from
the least effort, the smallest fatigue, overcome by heavy
inertia. Her face was like the delicate veil of ash that
covers a live coal, hiding its consumption.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear soul!" said Stelio, leaning toward her and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
lightly touching the pale cheek with his lips. "Lean on
me; give yourself entirely to me; have confidence in
me. Never will I fail you, never will you fail me. We
shall find it&mdash;we shall find the true secret on which our
love can rest forever, immovable. Do not be reserved
with me. Do not suffer alone, nor hide your sorrows
from me. When your heart swells with grief, speak to
me. Let me believe that I can comfort you. Let us
not hide anything from each other. I shall venture to
recall to you a condition that you yourself made. Speak
to me, and I will always answer you truthfully. Let
me help you&mdash;me, who have received from you so much
of good. Tell me that you do not fear to suffer. I believe
your soul capable of supporting all the sadness of
the world. Do not let me lose faith in that force of passion,
whereby more than once you have seemed to me
divine. Tell me you do not fear suffering.... I don't
know.... I may be mistaken. But I have felt a
shadow around you, like a desperate wish to withdraw
yourself, to leave me, to find some end. Why? Why?
And, just now, looking at all this terrible desolation that
smiles at us, a great fear suddenly filled my heart&mdash;I
thought that perhaps even your love might change like
all things, and pass away into nothingness. 'You will
lose me.' Ah, those words were yours, Foscarina! They
fell from your own lips."</p>

<p>She did not answer. For the first time since she had
loved him, his words seemed vain, useless sounds, moving
powerless through the air. For the first time, he
seemed to her a weak and anxious creature, bound by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
inexorable laws. She pitied him as well as herself. He
asked her to be heroic, a compact of grief and of violence.
At the moment when he attempted to console and comfort
her, he predicted a difficult test, prepared her for
torture. But what was courage worth, of what use was
any effort? What were all miserable human agitations
worth, and why think of the future, even of the uncertain
morrow?</p>

<p>The Past reigned supreme around them, and they
themselves were nothing, and everything was nothing.&mdash;We
are dying; both of us are dying. We dream, and
then we die.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush! Hush!" was all she said, softly, as if they
were in a cemetery. A slight smile touched her lips,
and rested there as fixedly as the smile on the lips of a
portrait.</p>

<p>The wheels rolled on over the white road, along the
shores of the Brenta. The stream, sung and praised
in the sonnets of the gallant abbés in the days when
gondolas laden with music and pleasure had glided
down its current, had now the humble aspect of a canal,
where the iris-necked ducks splashed in flocks. On the
damp, low plain the fields smoked, the bare trees showed
plainly, their leaves rotting on the damp earth. A slow,
golden mist floated above an immense vegetable decay
that seemed to encroach even upon the walls, the
stones, the houses, seeking to destroy them like the
leaves. The patrician villas&mdash;where a pale life, delicately
poisoned by cosmetics and perfumes, had burned itself
out in languid pastimes&mdash;were now in ruins, silent and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
abandoned. Some had an aspect like a human ruin,
with empty spaces that suggested hollow orbits and
toothless mouths; others were crumbling, and looked
as if ready to fall in powder, like a dead woman's hair
when her tomb is opened; and here, there, everywhere,
rose the still surviving statues. They seemed innumerable,
like a scattered people. Some were still white,
others were gray or yellow with lichens, or green and
spotted with moss. They stood in all sorts of attitudes:
goddesses, heroes, nymphs, seasons, hours, with their
bows and arrows, their wreaths, cornucopias, and torches,
with all the emblems of power, riches and pleasure,
exiled now from fountains, grottoes, labyrinths, arbors,
and porticoes: friends of the greenwood and the myrtle,
protectors of fleeting loves, witnesses of eternal vows,
figures of a dream far more ancient than the hands that
had carved them, and the eyes that had contemplated
them in the ruined gardens. And, in the sweet sunlight
of the dying season, their shadows were like the shadows
of the irrevocable Past&mdash;all, all that loves no
longer, laughs and weeps no more, never will live, never
will return. And the unspoken word on their marble
lips was the same that was expressed in the fixed smile
on the lips of the world-weary woman&mdash;NOTHING!</p>

</div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
THE LABYRINTH</h2>


<p>But that day they were to pass through other
shadows, to know other fears.</p>

<p>Henceforth the tragic meaning of life filled
both their minds, and they tried in vain to
banish the physical sadness which from moment to moment
made their spirits more clear yet more disturbed.
They clasped each other's hand, as if they were groping
in dark, dangerous places. They spoke little, but
often they gazed into each other's eyes, and the look
of the one poured into that of the other a wave of confused
emotion, the mingling of their love and horror.
But it did not calm their hearts.</p>

<p>"Shall we go farther?"</p>

<p>"Yes, let us go on."</p>

<p>Still they clasped each other's hand closely, as if they
were about to go through some strange test, and were
resolved to experiment as to what depths could be
reached by the combined force of their melancholy. At
the Dolo, the wheels made the chestnut-leaves rustle
and crackle beneath them, and the tall changing trees
flamed over their heads like crimson draperies on fire.
At a distance was the Villa Barbariga, silent, deserted,
of a reddish hue in its denuded garden, showing vestiges
of old paintings in the cracks of its façade, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
streaks of rouge on the wrinkled cheeks of an old woman.
And, at every glance, the distances of the landscape
seemed fainter and bluer, like things slowly submerged.</p>

<p>"Here is Strà."</p>

<p>They alighted before the Villa Pisani, and, accompanied
by its guardian, they visited the deserted apartments.
They heard the sound of their own footsteps on
the marble that reflected them, the echoes in the historic
arches, the creaking of the doors, the tiresome voice of
the keeper awakening the memories of the place. The
rooms were vast, hung with faded draperies and furnished
in the style of the Empire, with Napoleonic emblems.
The walls of one room were covered with portraits
of the Pisani, procurators of San Marco; of another,
with marble medallions of all the Doges; of a
third, with a series of flowers painted in water-colors
and mounted in delicate frames, pale as the dry flowers
that are laid under glass, in memory of love or death.</p>

<p>As La Foscarina entered one room, she said:</p>

<p>"<em>In time!</em> Here, too!"</p>

<p>There, on a bracket, stood a transformation into
marble of <cite>La Vecchia</cite> by Francesco Torbido, made even
more repulsive by the relief, by the subtle skill of the
sculptor, to bring out with his chisel each tendon,
wrinkle, and hollow place in the old woman's face. And
at the doors of this room seemed to appear the ghosts
of the crowned women that had hidden their unhappiness
and their decay in that vast dwelling, at once like
a palace and a monastery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maria Luisa di Parma, in eighteen hundred and seventeen,"
continued the monotonous voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, the Queen of Spain, wife of Charles the Fourth,
and mistress of Manuel Godoï," said Stelio. "She attracts
me more than all the others. She came here when
they were in exile. Do you know whether she stayed
here with the King and the favorite!"</p>

<p>But the guardian knew only that name and the date.</p>

<p>"Why does she attract you?" La Foscarina asked. "I
know nothing of her history."</p>

<p>"Her end, the last years of her life of exile, after so
much struggle and passion, are extraordinarily full of
poetry."</p>

<p>And he described that violent and tenacious character,
the weak, credulous King, the handsome adventurer who
had enjoyed the smiles of the Queen, and had been
dragged through the streets by the infuriated mob; the
agitations of the three lives bound together by Fate,
and swept before Napoleon's will like leaves in a whirlwind;
the tumult at Aranjuez, the abdication, the exile.</p>

<p>"And Godoï&mdash;the Prince of Peace, as the King called
him&mdash;faithfully followed the sovereigns into exile; he
remained faithful to his royal mistress, and she to him.
They all lived together under the same roof thenceforth,
and Charles never doubted the virtue of Maria Luisa.
Even to the day of his death, he lavished all manner of
kindness on the two lovers. Imagine their life in this
place; imagine here such a love coming safely through
a storm so terrible. All was broken down, overthrown,
reduced to powder by the destroyer. Bonaparte had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
passed that way, but had not smothered that love, already
old, beneath the ruins. The faithfulness of those
two violent natures moves my heart not less than the
credulity of the kindly King. Thus they grew old.
Imagine it! The Queen died first, then the King; and
the favorite, who was younger than they, lived a wandering
life a few years more."</p>

<p>"This is the Emperor's room," said the guardian solemnly,
flinging open a door.</p>

<p>The great shade seemed omnipresent in the villa of
the Doge Alvise. The imperial eagle, symbol of his
power, dominated all the faded relics. But in the yellow
room, the shade seemed to occupy the vast bed, to rest
under the canopy, surrounded by the four bedposts ornamented
at the top with golden flames. The formidable
sigla inscribed within the laurel crown shone upon the
polished side of the bed. And this species of funereal
couch seemed to be prolonged in the dim mirror hanging
between the two figures of Victory that supported the
candelabra.</p>

<p>"Did the Emperor sleep in this bed?" inquired the
young man of the custodian, who pointed out to him on
the wall the portrait of the great <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">condottiere</i> mantled in
ermine, wearing a crown of laurel and holding a scepter,
as he appeared at the coronation blessed by Pius VII.
"Is it certain?"</p>

<p>He was surprised at himself at not feeling the emotion
experienced by ambitious spirits at the sight of the
traces of heroes&mdash;that strong throb he knew so well.</p>

<p>He lifted the edge of the yellow counterpane, and let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
it fall as suddenly as if the pillow under it had been full
of vermin.</p>

<p>"Let us go away from this place; let us go!" said La
Foscarina, who had been looking through the windows
at the park, where the golden bars of the setting sun
alternated with bluish-green zones of shade. "We cannot
breathe here," she added.</p>

<p>The air, in truth, was like that of a vault.</p>

<p>"Now we pass into the room of Maximilian of Austria,"
said the droning voice, "he took the dressing-room
of Amélie de Beauharnais for his bedroom."</p>

<p>They crossed this apartment in a flood of crimson
light. The sunlight struck on a crimson couch, flashed
rainbows from a frail chandelier with crystal drops that
hung from the ceiling and kindled perpendicular red lines
on the wall. Stelio stopped on the threshold, evoking in
his fancy as he did so, the pensive figure of the young
Archduke, with blue eyes, that fair flower of Hapsburg
fallen in a barbaric land one summer morning!</p>

<p>"Let us go!" begged La Foscarina again, seeing him
still delay.</p>

<p>She hastened through the immense salon, painted in
fresco by Tiepolo; the Corinthian bronze gate closing behind
her gave forth a clang as resonant as the stroke
of a bell, sending prolonged vibrations through space.
She flew along, terrified, as if the whole palace were
about to crumble and fall, and the light to fail, and she
dreaded lest she should find herself alone among the
shadows with these phantoms of unhappiness and death.
As Stelio followed, through the space wherein the air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
was moved by her flight, between those walls enclosing
relics, behind the famous actress who had simulated the
fury of deadly passions, the desperate efforts of will and
of desire, and the violent conflict of splendid destines on
the stage of all lands, the warm blood in his veins grew
chill, as if he were passing through a freezing atmosphere;
he felt his heart grow cold, his courage flag; his
reason for being lost its hold on his mind, and the magnificent
illusions with which he had fed his soul, that it
might surpass itself and his destiny, wavered and were
dispersed.</p>

<p>"Are we still living?" he asked, when they found themselves
in the air without, in the park, far from the unwholesome
odor.</p>

<p>He took La Foscarina's hand, shook her gently, gazed
into her eyes and tried to smile; then he drew her into
the sunlight in the middle of the green meadow.</p>

<p>"What heat! Do you feel it? How sweet the grass
is!"</p>

<p>He half-closed his eyes, that he might feel the sun's
rays on his eyelids, and was once more filled with the
joy of living. The woman imitated him, calmed by the
pleasure her beloved showed; and she looked from under
her half-closed eyelids at his fresh, sensuous mouth.
They sat thus for some time, hand-in-hand, their feet
resting on the warm grass. Her thoughts turned back
to the Eugenean hills, which he had described, to the
villages pink as the buried shells, to the first drops of
rain on the tender leaves, Petrarch's fountain, to all
things fair and pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Life might still be sweet!" she sighed, in a voice
wherein was the miracle of hope born anew.</p>

<p>The heart of her beloved became like a fruit suddenly
ripened by a miraculous ray. Joy, delight, and tenderness
spread through his whole being. Once more he reveled
in the joy of the moment, as if it were the last of life.
Love was exalted above Destiny.</p>

<p>"Do you love me? Tell me?"</p>

<p>She made no answer, but she opened wide her eyes,
and the vastness of the universe was within the circle
of those pupils. Never was boundless love more powerfully
signified by mortal woman.</p>

<p>"Ah, life with thee is sweet, sweet&mdash;yesterday as well
as to-morrow!"</p>

<p>He seemed intoxicated with her, with the sunlight,
the grass, the divine sky, as with something never before
seen or possessed. The prisoner leaving his stifling
cell, the convalescent who beholds the sea after looking
death in the face, are not more intoxicated.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go now? Shall we leave our melancholy
behind us? Would you like to go to a country
where there is no autumn?"</p>

<p>&mdash;The autumn is in myself, and I carry it everywhere&mdash;she
thought; but she smiled the slight smile with which
she veiled her sadness.&mdash;It is I&mdash;it is I that must go
away alone; I will disappear; I will go far-away and
die, my love, O my love!&mdash;</p>

<p>During this moment of respite, she had not succeeded
either in conquering her sadness or reviving her hope;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
but her anguish was softened, and she had lost all bitterness
and rancor.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to go away?"</p>

<p>&mdash;To go away, always to be going away, to wander
throughout the world, to go long distances!&mdash;thought
the nomad woman.&mdash;Never to stop, never to rest! The
anxiety of the journey is not over yet, but already the
truce has expired. You wish to comfort me, my friend,
and, to console me, you propose that I should go far-away
once more, although I returned to my home, as it
were, but yesterday.&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes looked like two sparkling springs.</p>

<p>"Leave me in my home a little while longer. And
remain here, too, if that is possible. Later, you will be
free, you will be happy. You have so long a time before
you! You are young. You will win what you deserve.
They will not lose you, even if they must wait for you."</p>

<p>Her eyes had two crystal masks before them; they
glittered in the sunshine, and seemed almost fixed in
her fevered face.</p>

<p>"Ah, always the same shadow!" Stelio exclaimed, with
an impatience he could not conceal. "But what are you
thinking of? What do you fear? Why not tell me what
it is that troubles you? Explain yourself. Who is it
that must wait for me?"</p>

<p>She trembled with terror at that question, which
seemed new and unexpected, although he only repeated
her own last words. She trembled to find herself so
near danger, as if, in walking across this fair meadow,
a precipice had suddenly opened under her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>And suddenly, in that unfamiliar place, on that beautiful
grass, at the end of the day, after all those specters,
sanguinary or bloodless, rose a living image of will and
desire, which filled her with far greater terror. Suddenly,
above all the figures of the Past, arose the figure
of the Future, and again the aspect of her life was
changed; and the sweetness of the respite was already
lost, and the fair meadow with its sweet grass was
worth nothing.</p>

<p>"Yes, let us talk, if you wish."</p>

<p>But she was obliged to lift her face a little to keep
her tears from falling.</p>

<p>"Do not be sad!" pleaded the young man, whose soul
was suspended on those eyelids, whence the tears would
not fall. "You hold my heart in your hand. I never
will fail you. Then why torment yourself? I am wholly
yours."</p>

<p>For him, too, the image of Donatella was there, with
her rounded figure, her body as robust and agile as a
wingless Victory, armed with the glory of maidenhood,
attractive yet hostile, ready to struggle, and then to
yield. But his soul was suspended from the eyelids of
the other woman, like the tears that veiled the eyes
in which he had seen the vastness of the universe, the
infinity of love.</p>

<p>"Foscarina!"</p>

<p>At last the warm tears fell, but she did not let them
course down her cheeks. With one of those movements
that sometimes sprang from her sadness with the swift
grace of a freed wing, she checked them, moistened her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
finger-tips with them, and touched her temples without
drying them. And, while she still kept her tears upon
herself, she tried to smile.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Stelio. I am so weak!"</p>

<p>"Ah, dear fingers&mdash;beautiful as Sofia's! Let me kiss
them as they are, still wet."</p>

<p>Within his caressing arm, he drew her across the
field to a zone of golden green. Lightly, with his arm
supporting hers, he kissed her finger-tips, one after another,
more delicate than the buds of the tuberose. She
startled, and he felt her tremble at each touch of his lips.</p>

<p>"They are salt!"</p>

<p>"Take care, Stelio! Some one may see us."</p>

<p>"No one is here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps down there, in the hothouses."</p>

<p>"There is not a sound. Hark!"</p>

<p>"What a strange silence! It is ecstasy."</p>

<p>"We might hear the falling of a leaf."</p>

<p>"And the keeper?"</p>

<p>"He has gone to meet some other visitor."</p>

<p>"Does anyone ever come here?"</p>

<p>"The other day Richard Wagner came here with
Daniela von Bülow."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, the niece of the Countess Agoult, of 'Daniel
Stern.'"</p>

<p>"And, among all those phantoms, with which did that
great stricken heart converse?"</p>

<p>"Who can tell?"</p>

<p>"Only with himself, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look at the glass windows and walls of the conservatories&mdash;how
they sparkle! They appear iridescent.
Rain, sunshine and time have painted it in that way.
Does it not seem to reflect a distant twilight? Perhaps
you have sometimes stopped on the Pesaro quay, to look
at the beautiful pentafore window of the Evangelists. If
you raised your eyes, you could see the windows of the
palace marvelously painted by the changes of weather."</p>

<p>"You know all the secrets of Venice!"</p>

<p>"Not all yet."</p>

<p>"How warm it is here! See how tall those cedars are.
There is a swallow's nest hanging on that limb."</p>

<p>"The swallows went away very late this year."</p>

<p>"Will you really take me to the Euganean hills in the
spring?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Foscarina, I should like to do so."</p>

<p>"Spring is so far-away!"</p>

<p>"Life can still be sweet."</p>

<p>"We are living in a dream."</p>

<p>"Look at Orpheus with his lyre, all dressed in lichens."</p>

<p>"Ah, what a land of dreams! No one comes here any
more. Grass, grass everywhere! There is not a single
human footstep."</p>

<p>"Deucalion with his stones, Ganymede with his eagle,
Diana with her stag&mdash;all the gods of mythology."</p>

<p>"How many statues! But these, at least, are not in
exile. The ancient hornbeams still protect them."</p>

<p>"Here strolled Maria Luisa di Parma, between the
King and the favorite. From time to time she would
pause to listen to the click of the blades that cut the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
hornbeams to form arches. She would let fall her handkerchief,
perfumed with jessamine, and Don Manuel
Godoï would pick it up with a graceful gesture, hiding
the pain he suffered when he stooped&mdash;a souvenir of
the outrages he had endured at the hands of the mob
in the streets of Aranjuez. How warm the sun was,
and how excellent the snuff in its enameled box, when
the King said with a smile: 'Certainly, our dear Bonaparte
is not so well off at Saint Helena as we are here.'
But the demon of power, of struggle, and of passion was
still alive in the Queen's heart. Look at those red
roses!"</p>

<p>"They fairly burn. One would think each had a live
coal at its heart. Yes, they seem actually to burn."</p>

<p>"The sun is growing red. This is the hour for the
Chioggia sails on the lagoon."</p>

<p>"Gather a rose for me."</p>

<p>"Here is one."</p>

<p>"Oh, but its leaves are falling."</p>

<p>"Well, here is another."</p>

<p>"These leaves are falling too."</p>

<p>"They are all at the point of death. Perhaps this one
is not."</p>

<p>"Do not break it off."</p>

<p>"Look! These seem to be redder still. Bonifazio's
velvet&mdash;do you remember it? It has the same strength."</p>

<p>"'The inmost flower of the flame.'"</p>

<p>"What a memory!"</p>

<p>"Listen! They are closing the doors of the conservatories."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is time to go," said Stelio, abruptly yet gently.</p>

<p>"The air is beginning to be cooler."</p>

<p>"Do you feel cold?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet."</p>

<p>"Did you leave your cloak in the carriage?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We will wait at Dolo for the train, and return to
Venice by the railway."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We still have time to spare."</p>

<p>"What is this? Look!"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"What a bitter odor! It is a sort of shrubbery of
box and hornbeams."</p>

<p>"Ah, it is the labyrinth!"</p>

<p>A rusty iron gate barred the entrance to the labyrinth
between two columns that bore two Cupids riding
on stone dolphins. Nothing was to be seen on the other
side of the gate, except the beginning of the path, and
a kind of solidly built and intricate thicket, dark and
mysterious. In the center of the maze rose a tower, at
the summit of which stood the statue of a warrior, as
if reconnoitering from that point.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in a labyrinth?" Stelio inquired.</p>

<p>"No, never," she replied.</p>

<p>They lingered to examine the entrance to the deceptive
playground, composed by an ingenious gardener for
the amusement of ladies and their cavaliers in the days
of hoops and flowered waistcoats. But age and neglect
had rendered it mournful and wild, had deprived it of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
all appearance of grace and regularity, and had changed
it into thick yellowish-brown woodland, full of inextricable
turns through which the slanting rays of the setting
sun shone so red that some of the shrubs looked like
smokeless fire.</p>

<p>"It is open," said Stelio, feeling the gate yield as he
leaned on it. "Do you see?"</p>

<p>He pushed back the rusty iron gate, took a step forward,
and crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked his companion, with
instinctive fear, putting out a hand to detain him.</p>

<p>"Do you not wish to go in?"</p>

<p>She was perplexed. But the labyrinth attracted them
with its mystery, illumined by deep flames.</p>

<p>"Suppose we should lose ourselves?"</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself that it is very small. We
can easily find the gate again."</p>

<p>"And suppose we don't find it?"</p>

<p>He laughed at this childish fear.</p>

<p>"We might remain in there through all eternity!" he
said.</p>

<p>"No, no! No one is anywhere near. Let us go away."</p>

<p>She tried to draw him back, but he defended himself,
stepping backward toward the path. Suddenly he disappeared,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Stelio! Stelio!"</p>

<p>She could see him no longer, but she heard his ringing
laughter in the midst of the wild thicket.</p>

<p>"Come back! come back!"</p>

<p>"No, no! Come in and find me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stelio, come back! You will be lost," she called.</p>

<p>"I shall find Ariadne."</p>

<p>At that name, she felt her heart throb suddenly, then
contract, then palpitate confusedly. Was not that the
name he had called Donatella, that first night? Had he
not called her Ariadne down there, in the gondola, while
seated at the young girl's feet? She even remembered
his words: "Ariadne possesses a divine gift, whereby
her power transcends all limits." She recalled his accent,
his attitude, his look.</p>

<p>Tumultuous anguish seized upon her, obscured her
reason, prevented her from realizing the spontaneity of
the happening, and the simple careless jest in her friend's
speech. The terror that lay hidden in the depths of her
love rose in rebellion, mastered her, blinded her with
misery. The trifling little accident assumed an appearance
of cruelty and derision. She could still hear that
laugh ringing from the melancholy maze.</p>

<p>"Stelio!"</p>

<p>In her frantic hallucination, she cried out as if she had
seen him embraced by the other woman, torn from her
arms forever.</p>

<p>"Stelio!"</p>

<p>"Come and find me!" he answered laughing, still invisible.</p>

<p>She rushed into the labyrinth to find him, and advanced
straight toward the voice and the laugh, guided
by her impulse. But the path turned; a wall of bushes
rose before her, impenetrable, and stopped her. She followed
the winding, deceiving path; but one turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
followed another, and all looked alike, and the circle
seemed to have no end.</p>

<p>"Look for me!" cried the voice from a distance,
through the living hedges.</p>

<p>"Where are you? Where are you? Can you see me?"</p>

<p>She looked about for some opening in the hedge
through which she might see. But all she saw was
thick, interlacing branches, and the redness of the setting
sun which lighted them on one side, while shadows
darkened them on the other. The box-bushes and the
hornbeams were so closely mingled that they increased
momentarily the bewilderment of the breathless woman.</p>

<p>"I am losing myself! Come and meet me!"</p>

<p>Again that boyish laugh came from the maze.</p>

<p>"Ariadne, Ariadne! the thread!"</p>

<p>Now the words came from the opposite side, striking
her heart as if with a blow.</p>

<p>"Ariadne!"</p>

<p>She turned back, ran, turned again, tried to break
through the hedge, to see through the undergrowth, to
break the branches. She saw nothing but the maze,
always the same in every direction. At last she heard
a step, so close that she thought it must be just behind
her, and she started. But she was deceived. Again
she explored her green prison; she listened, waited; she
could hear no sound but her own breathing and the
beating of her heart. The silence had become absolute.
She gazed at the clear sky, curving in its immensity
over the two green walls that held her prisoner. She
felt that that immensity and narrowness were the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
things in the world. And she could not succeed in
separating in her thoughts the reality of that place from
the image of her mental torture, the natural aspect of
things from that kind of living allegory created by her
own anguish.</p>

<p>"Stelio, where are you?"</p>

<p>No reply. She listened and waited in vain. The seconds
seemed like hours.</p>

<p>"Where are you? I am afraid!"</p>

<p>No reply. But where was he, then? Had he found
the way out? Had he left her there all alone? Would
he continue to play this cruel game?</p>

<p>A mad desire to scream, to sob, to throw herself on
the ground, to hurt herself, to make herself ill, to die,
assailed the distracted woman. Again she raised her
eyes to the silent sky. The tops of the tall hornbeams
were reddened, like logs when they have ceased to blaze
and are about to fall in ashes.</p>

<p>"I can see you!" suddenly said a laughing voice, in
the deep shadows, very near her.</p>

<p>"Where are you?"</p>

<p>He laughed among the leaves, but without revealing
himself, like a faun in hiding. This game excited him;
his body grew warm and supple by this exercise of his
agility; and the wild mystery, the contact with the earth,
the odor of autumn, the strangeness of this unexpected
adventure, the woman's bewilderment, even the presence
of the marble deities mingled with his physical pleasure
an illusion of antique poetry and grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are you? Oh, do not play any more! Do not
laugh in that way! Enough!"</p>

<p>He had crept, bareheaded, into the bushes on his hands
and knees. He felt the dead leaves, the soft moss. And
as he breathed among the branches, and felt his heart
throb with the strange delight of the situation, with the
communion between his own life and the vegetable life
around him, the spell of his fancy renewed among
those winding ways the industry of the first maker of
wings, the myth of the monster that was born of Pasiphaë
and the Bull, the Attic legend of Theseus in Crete.
All that ancient world became real to him. In that
glowing autumn evening, he was transfigured, according
to the instincts of his blood and the recollections of his
mind, into one of those ambiguous forms, half animal
and half divine, one of those glittering genii whose
throats were swollen with the same gland that hangs
from the neck of the goat. A joyous voluptuousness suggested
strange surprises to him, suggested the swiftness
of pursuit, of flight, capture, and a fleeting embrace in
the shadows of the wood. Then he desired some one
like himself, fresh youthfulness that could share his
laughter, two light feet to fly before him, two arms to
resist him, a prize to capture at last. Donatella with her
curved figure recurred to his mental vision.</p>

<p>"Enough, Stelio! I cannot run any more. I shall
fall."</p>

<p>La Foscarina uttered a scream on feeling her skirt
pulled by a hand that had reached through the shrubbery.
She bent down, and saw in the shadows the face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of a laughing faun. The laughter struck her ear without
calming her distress, without breaking the sense of suffering
that overpowered her. As she looked at his boyish
face, she saw at the same instant the face of the
singer, who seemed to be stooping with her, imitating
her movement as if she were a shadow. Her mind became
more confused, and she could not distinguish between
illusion and reality. The other woman seemed
to overthrow her, oppress her, suffocate her.</p>

<p>"Leave me! Leave me! It is not I whom you seek!"</p>

<p>Her voice was so changed that Stelio broke off his
laughter and his sport, withdrew his arm, and rose to
his feet. She could not see him; the leafy, impenetrable
wall was between them again.</p>

<p>"Take me away from this place. I cannot bear any
more. My strength is gone. I suffer."</p>

<p>He could find no words to comfort her. The simultaneous
coincidence of his recent thought of Donatella,
and her sudden divination of it, impressed him deeply.</p>

<p>"Wait a little! I will try to find the way out. I will
call some one."</p>

<p>"Are you going away?"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid! There is no danger."</p>

<p>But while he spoke thus to reassure her, he felt the
inaneness of his words&mdash;the incongruity between that
laughable adventure and the obscure emotion born of
a far different cause. And now he too felt the strange
ambiguity whereby the trifling event appeared in two
confusing aspects: a suppressed desire to laugh persisted
under his concern for her, so that his perturbation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
was new to him, like wild agitations born of extravagant
dreams.</p>

<p>"Do not go away!" she implored, a prey to her hallucinations.
"Perhaps we can meet there at the next turning.
Let us try. Take my hands."</p>

<p>Through an opening, he took her hands; he started
on touching them; they were icy cold.</p>

<p>"Foscarina, what is the matter? Are you really ill?
Wait! I will try to break through."</p>

<p>He attempted to break down the hedge, and snapped
off a few twigs, but its thickness resisted him, and he
scratched his hands uselessly.</p>

<p>"No, it is impossible."</p>

<p>"Cry out! Call some one."</p>

<p>He cried aloud in the silence.</p>

<p>The top of the hedge had lost its deep color, but a
red light now spread over the sky above them. A triangle
of wild ducks passed in sweeping flight.</p>

<p>"Let me go, Foscarina. I shall find the tower easily,
and will call from there. Some one will be sure to hear
me."</p>

<p>"No! No!"</p>

<p>But she heard him move away, followed the sound of
his steps, and was once more bewildered by the maze,
once more alone and lost. She stopped, waited, listened,
and looked at the sky. She lost all sense of time; the
seconds seemed hours.</p>

<p>"Stelio! Stelio!"</p>

<p>She was no longer capable of an effort to control her
disordered and exasperated mind. She felt the approach
of a crisis of mad fear, as one feels the approach of a
whirlwind.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>"Stelio!"</p>
<p>He heard that cry full of anguish, and hastened his
search along the winding paths that first seemed to lead
him toward the tower and then away from it. The
laughter had frozen in his heart. His whole soul shook
to its foundation every time his name reached him, uttered
by that invisible agony. And the gradual lessening
of the light brought up an image of blood that is flowing
away, of slowly fading life.</p>

<p>"I am here! I am here!"</p>

<p>One of the paths brought him at last to the open
space where the tower stood. He ran furiously up the
winding stairs, felt dizzy when he reached the top, closed
his eyes while grasping the railing, opened them again,
and saw a long zone of fire on the horizon, the disk
of the rayless moon, the gray plain, and the labyrinth
below him, black and spotted with box-bush and horn-beam,
narrow in its endless convolutions, looking like a
dismantled edifice covered with wild vines.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop! Do not run like that! Some one has
heard me. A man is coming. I can see him coming.
Wait! Stop!"</p>

<p>He watched the woman turning and running like a
mad creature along the dark, delusive paths, like something
condemned to vain torture, to some useless but
eternal fatigue, like a sister of the fabulous martyrs.</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>It seemed that she did not hear him, or that she could
not control her fatal agitation, and that he could not
rescue her, but must always remain there, a witness of
that terrible chastisement.</p>

<p>"Here he is!"</p>

<p>One of the keepers had heard their cries, had approached
them, and now entered by the gateway. Stelio
met him at the foot of the tower, and together they
hastened to find the lost woman. The man knew the
secret of the labyrinth, and Stelio prevented any chatter
and jests by surprising him with his generosity.</p>

<p>"Has she lost consciousness&mdash;has she fallen?" The
darkness and the silence were sinister, and he felt
alarmed. She did not answer when he called her, and
he could not hear her footsteps. Night had already fallen
on the place, and a damp veil was descending from the
purple sky.</p>

<p>"Shall I find her in a swoon upon the ground," he
thought.</p>

<p>He started at seeing a mysterious figure appear at a
turning, with a pale face that attracted all the last rays
of daylight, white as a pearl, with large, fixed eyes, and
lips closely compressed.</p>

<p>They turned back toward the Dolo, taking the same
route beside the Brenta. She never spoke, never opened
her lips, never answered, as if she could not unclose her
teeth. She lay in the bottom of the carriage, wrapped
in her cloak, and now and then she shook with a deep
shudder, as one attacked by malarial fever. Her friend
tried to take her hands in his to warm them, but in vain&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
were inert and lifeless. And as they drove along,
the statues passed and passed beside them.</p>

<p>The river flowed black between its banks, under the
purple and silver sky; the moon was rising. A black
boat came down the stream, towed by two gray horses
with heavy hoofs, led by a man who whistled cheerfully,
and the funnel smoked on the deck like a chimney on a
hut. The yellow light of a lantern flashed, and the odor
of supper floated on the air; and here and there, as they
drove along, the statues passed and passed beside them.</p>

<p>It was like a Stygian landscape, like a vision of Hades,
a region of shadows, mist, and water. Everything grew
misty and vanished like spirits. The moon enchanted
and attracted the plain, as it enchants and attracts the
water, absorbing the vapors of earth with insatiable,
silent thirst. Solitary pools shone everywhere; small,
silvery canals were visible, glittering at uncertain distances.
Earth seemed to be gradually losing its solidity,
and the sky seemed to regard its own melancholy reflected
in innumerable placid mirrors.</p>

<p>And here and there, along the banks of the stream,
like the ghosts of a people disappeared, the statues
passed and passed!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
THE POWER OF THE FLAME</h2>


<p>"Do you think often of Donatella, Stelio?" La
Foscarina inquired suddenly, after a long
silence, during which neither had heard anything
but the sound of their own footsteps
along the canal path of the Vetrai, illumined by the
multi-colored lights from the fragile objects that filled
the windows of the neighboring shops.</p>

<p>Her voice sounded harsh and strained. Stelio stopped
suddenly, as one who finds himself confronted by an
unexpected difficulty. His spirit had been roaming over
the red and green isle of Murano, begemmed with flowers
in her present desolate poverty, which seemed to blot
out the memory of the joyous time when poets had sung
her praises as "a sojourn for nymphs and demigods." He
had been thinking of the famous gardens where Andrea
Navagero, Cardinal Bembo, Aretino, Aldo, and their
learned followers, rivaled one another in the elegance of
their Platonic dialogues, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lauri sub umbra</i>. He had been
thinking of convents, luxurious as boudoirs, inhabited by
little nuns dressed in white camelot and laces, with curls
on their temples, and necks uncovered, after the fashion
of the ancient honored courtesans, given to secret loves,
much sought after by wealthy patricians, with such euphonious
names as Ancilla Soranzo, Cipriana Morosini,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Zanetta Balbi, Beatrice Falier, Eugenia Muschiera, pious
instructors in the ways of love. His changeful dreams
were accompanied by a plaintive little air, a forgotten
dance measure, in which the faint soul of Murano tinkled
and whispered.</p>

<p>At this abrupt question, the air fled from his memory,
all imaginings were dispersed, the enchantment of the
old life vanished. His wandering mind was called back,
and came with reluctance. He felt beside him the throbbing
of a living heart, which he must inevitably wound.
He looked at his friend.</p>

<p>She was walking beside the canal, calm, with no sign
of agitation, between the green water and the iridescence
of the rows of delicate vases. Only her slender
chin trembled slightly, between her short veil and fur
collar.</p>

<p>"Yes, sometimes," he replied, after an instant of hesitation,
recoiling from falsehood, and feeling the necessity
to elevate their love above ordinary deceptions and
pretensions, so that it should remain for him a cause
of strength, not of weakness, a free agreement, not a
heavy chain.</p>

<p>She pursued her way without wavering, but she had
lost all consciousness of movement in the terrible throbbing
of her heart, which shook her from head to foot. She
saw nothing more: all she was aware of was the nearness
of the fascinating water.</p>

<p>"Her voice is unforgettable," Stelio went on, after a
pause, having found his courage. "Its power is amazing.
From that first evening, I have thought that that singer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
might be the marvelous instrument for my great work.
I wish she would consent to sing the lyric parts of my
tragedy, the odes that arise from the symphonies and
resolve themselves into figures of the dance at the end,
between episodes. La Tanagra has consented to dance.
I have confidence in your good offices, dear friend, to
obtain also the consent of Donatella Arvale. Thus the
Dionysiac trinity would be reëstablished in a perfect
manner on the new stage, for the joy of mankind."</p>

<p>Even while he spoke he realized that his words had a
false ring, that his unconscious air contrasted too crudely
with the dark shadow on the woman's face. In spite of
himself, he had exaggerated his frank tone in speaking
of Donatella merely as an instrument of art, a purely
ideal force to be drawn into the circle of his magnificent
enterprise. In spite of himself, disturbed by the anxiety
in that soul so near his own, he had leaned slightly
toward deception. Certainly what he had said was the
exact truth, but his friend had demanded from him another
truth. He broke off suddenly, unable to endure
the sound of his own words. He felt that at that hour,
between the actress and himself, art had no meaning,
no vital value. Another force dominated them, more
imperious, more disquieting. The world created by intellect
seemed inert as the ancient stones on which they
trod. The only real and formidable power was the poison
running in their human blood. The will of the one said:
"It is my will that you shall love and serve me, wholly,
mine alone, body and soul." The will of the other said:
"It is my will that you shall love and serve me, but while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
I live I shall renounce nothing that may appeal to my
wish and fancy." The struggle was bitter and unequal.</p>

<p>As she remained silent, unconsciously hastening her
steps, he prepared himself to face the other truth.</p>

<p>"I understand, of course, that that was not what you
wished to know."</p>

<p>"You are right: it was not that. Well?"</p>

<p>She turned to him with a sort of convulsive violence
that reminded him of her fury one far-off evening, when
she had cried madly: "Go! Run! She awaits you!"</p>

<p>At this moment a workman met them, and offered to
show them over the neighboring glass factory.</p>

<p>"Yes, let us go in there," said La Foscarina, hurriedly
following the workman. Presently they reached the furnace room,
and were enveloped in its fiery breath, as they
gazed at an incandescent altar, the glow from which
dazzled their eyes with a painful glare.</p>

<p>&mdash;To disappear, to be swallowed up, to leave no sign!&mdash;cried
the woman's heart, intoxicated with the thought
of destruction.&mdash;In one second that fire could devour me
like a dry stick, a bundle of straw.&mdash;And she went nearer
to the open mouths in which she could see the molten
flame, more resplendent than a midsummer sun, rolling
around the earthen pots in which the shapeless mass
was melting; the workmen, standing around, awaited the
right moment to approach with iron tubes to shape that
mass with the breath from their lips and the instruments
of their art.</p>

<p>&mdash;O virtue of Fire!&mdash;thought the Inspirer, turned from
his anxiety by the miraculous beauty of the element that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
had become to him as familiar as a brother, since the
day he had found the revealing melody.&mdash;Ah, that I
might give to the life of the creatures that love me the
perfection of the forms to which I aspire! That I might
fuse all their weaknesses in some white heat, and make
of the product obedient matter in which to impress the
commandments of my heroic will and the images of my
pure poetry! Why, my friend, why will you not be
the divine living statue molded by my spirit, the work
of faith and sorrow whereby our lives might surpass even
our art? Why are we so near resembling ordinary lovers,
who lament and curse? When I heard from your lips
those admirable words: 'I can do one thing that love
alone cannot do,' I believed indeed that you could give
me more than love. You must be able always to do
those things that love can do, besides those it cannot
do, in order to meet my insatiable nature.&mdash;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, work was going on about the furnace.
At the end of the blow pipes the molten glass swelled,
twisted, became silvery as a little cloud, shone like the
moon, cracked, divided into a thousand infinitesimal
fragments, glittering and thin as the threads we see at
daybreak stretching from tree to tree. The glass-blowers
were making harmonious vases. The apprentices placed
a small, pear-shaped mass of burning paste on the spot
chosen by the master-workmen; and the pear lengthened,
twisted, transformed itself into a handle, a rim, a spout,
a foot, or a stem. The glowing heat slowly died out
under the instruments, and the half-formed cup was
again exposed to the heat, then drawn from it docile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
ductile, sensitive to the lightest touches that ornamented
and refined it, conforming it to the model handed down
by their ancestors, or to the free invention of a new
creator.</p>

<p>Extraordinarily light and agile were the human gestures
that produced these elegant creatures of the fire,
of breath and iron; they were like the movements of a
silent dance. The figure of La Tanagra appeared to
the Inspirer among the perpetual undulations of the
flame, like a salamander. Donatella's voice seemed to
sing to him the powerful melody.</p>

<p>&mdash;To-day, again, I myself have given you the thought
of her for a companion&mdash;thought La Foscarina&mdash;I myself
have called her up between us, and evoked her shadow
when perhaps your thoughts were elsewhere; I have
suddenly led her to you, as on that night of delirium.&mdash;</p>

<p>It was true, it was true! From the instant when the
singer's name had been spoken on the water by Foscarina,
she herself had unconsciously exalted the new
image in the poet's mind, had nourished it with her
jealousy and fear, had strengthened and increased it
day by day, and had at last illumined it with certainty.
More than once she had said to the young man, who
perhaps had forgotten: "She awaits you!" More than
once she had presented to his imagination that distant,
mysterious figure of expectancy. As on that Dionysian
night, when the conflagration of Venice had lighted up
the two youthful faces with the same reflection, it was
now her own passion that illumined them, and they
glowed only because she herself had made them.&mdash;Certainly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
he now possesses that image, and it possesses
him. My anguish only augments his ardor. It is a joy
to him to love her before my despairing eyes!&mdash;</p>

<p>"As soon as the vase is shaped, we put it in the furnace
room to be tempered," replied one of the men to
a query from Stelio. "If it were exposed to the air
immediately it would crack in a thousand pieces."</p>

<p>They could see the radiant vases, still slaves of the
fire, still under its empire, gathered in a receptacle joined
to the furnace in which they had been fused.</p>

<p>"They have been there ten hours," said the workman,
pointing to his graceful family. "Is this our great Foscarina?"
he added in an undertone to Stelio. He had
recognized her when she had lifted her veil, suffocating
with the heat.</p>

<p>Revealing ingenuous emotion, the master workman
took a step toward her and bowed respectfully.</p>

<p>"One evening, my lady, you made me tremble and
weep like a child. Will you allow me, in memory of
that evening, which I never shall forget, to offer you a
little work from the hands of the poor Seguso?"</p>

<p>"A Seguso, are you?" said the poet, leaning toward
the little man, to look at him closer; "are you of the
great family of glass-blowers, one of the genuine race?"</p>

<p>"At your service, master."</p>

<p>"A prince, then."</p>

<p>"Yes, a harlequin playing the prince."</p>

<p>"You know all the secrets of the art, eh?"</p>

<p>The Muranese made a mysterious gesture which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
seemed to call up all the deep ancestral knowledge of
which he affirmed himself the last heir.</p>

<p>"Then, mistress, will you deign to accept it?"</p>

<p>La Foscarina had not spoken, fearing to trust her
voice, but now all her affable grace rose above her
sadness and accepted the gift while compensating the
giver.</p>

<p>The vase held by the little bent man that had created
it was like a miraculous flower blooming on a twisted
shrub. It was a thing of beauty, mysterious as natural
things are mysterious; it held the life of a human breath
in its hollow; its transparence equaled that of sky and
water; its purple rim was like a floating seaweed; no
one could have told the reason why it was so beautiful;
and its value was either slight or beyond price, according
to the eyes that looked at it.</p>

<p>La Foscarina chose to take it with her, without having
it packed, as one carries a flower.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
REMINISCENCE</h2>


<p>They left the factory, and walked along a road
that was enclosed between the walls of silent
gardens. The bronze-like laurels were touched
with gold at the tops by the setting sun. The
air was filled with sparkling gold-dust.</p>

<p>"How sweet and terrible was the fate of Gaspara
Stampa," said Stelio. "Do you know her <em>Sonnets</em>? Yes,
I saw them one day on your table. She was a strange
mingling of ice and fire. Sometimes her mortal passion,
above the Petrarchism of Aretino, lifted a glorious cry.
I remember a magnificent verse of hers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<p class="indent poetry">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vivere ardendo e non sentire il male!</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"Do you remember, Stelio," said La Foscarina, with
that peculiar slight smile of hers which gave her face
the look of one walking in her sleep, "do you remember
the sonnet that begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<p class="indent poetry">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Signore, io so che in me non son più viva,<br />
E veggo omai ch'ancor in voi son morta?</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"I don't remember, Fosca."</p>

<p>"Do you remember your beautiful fancy about the
dead Summer? Summer was lying on a funeral barge,
dressed in gold like a dogaressa, and the procession was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
bearing her toward the Island of Murano, where a master
of the flame was to enclose her in a shroud of
opalescent glass, so that when she should be submerged
in the depths of the lagoon, she could at least watch
the waving seaweed. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"It was an evening in September."</p>

<p>"The last night of September, the night of the Allegory.
There was a great light on the water. You
were in an exalted mood, and talked and talked. What
things you said! You had come from solitude, and
your overcharged soul broke forth. You poured a
sparkling wave of poetry over your companion. A bark
passed, laden with pomegranates. I called myself Perdita.
Do you remember?"</p>

<p>As she walked she felt the extreme lightness of her
step and felt that something in her was vanishing, as
if her body were on the point of being changed to an
empty chrysalis.</p>

<p>"My name was still Perdita. Stelio, do you recall
another sonnet of Gaspara's beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<p class="indent poetry">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Io vorrei pur che Amor dicesse come<br />
Debbo seguirlo....</i></p>
</div>

<p>And the madrigal beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Se tu credi piacere al mio signore?</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"I did not know you were so familiar with the unhappy
Anasilla, my dear."</p>

<p>"Ah, I will tell you. I was hardly fourteen years
old when I played in an old romantic tragedy called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
<cite>Gaspara Stampa</cite>. I played the leading part. It was at
Dolo, where we passed the other day on our way to
Strà. We played in a small rustic theater&mdash;a kind of
tent. It was the year before my mother died. I remember
it very well. I can remember the sound of my own
voice, which was weak then, when I forced it in the
tirades because some one in the wings kept whispering
to me to speak louder, louder!... Well, Gaspara was
despairing; she wept and raved for her cruel Count.
There were many things about it all that my small, profaned
soul did not know or understand, and I know not
what instinct and comprehension of sorrow led me to
find the accent and the cries that could stir the miserable
crowd from which we expected to gain our daily
bread. Ten hungry persons used me as a breadwinner;
brutal necessity cut and tore away from me all the
dream-flowers born of my trembling precocity. Oh, it
was a time of weeping and suffocation, of terror, of
unthinking weariness, of mute horror. Those that martyrized
me knew not what they were doing, poor creatures,
made stupid by poverty and work. God pardon
them and give them peace! Only my mother&mdash;she, too,
who 'for having loved too well and been too little loved,
unhappy lived and died'&mdash;only my mother had pity
on my pain, and knew how to take me in her arms, how
to calm my horrible trembling, to weep when I wept,
to console me. My blessed mother!"</p>

<p>Her voice changed. Her mother's eyes once again
looked upon her, kind and firm and infinite as a peaceful
horizon.&mdash;Tell me, tell me what I must do! Guide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
me, teach me, you who know!&mdash;Her heart felt again the
clasp of those arms, and from the distance of years the
old pain came back, but not harshly; it was almost
sweet. The memory of her struggles and her sufferings
seemed to bathe her soul in a warm wave, to sustain
and comfort it. The test had been hard and the victory
difficult, obtained at the price of persistent labor,
against brutal and hostile forces. She had witnessed the
deepest misery and ruin, she had known heroic efforts,
pity, horror, and the face of Death.</p>

<p>"I know what hunger is, Stelio, and what the approach
of night seems like when a place of rest is uncertain,"
she said softly.</p>

<p>She stopped between the high walls, and lifted her
little veil, looking deep into her friend's eyes.
He grew pale under that look, so sudden was his
emotion and surprise at her words. He felt confused,
as if in the incoherence of a dream, incapable of applying
the true significance of those words to the woman
who was smiling at him, holding the delicate glass in
her ungloved hand. Yet he had heard what she said,
and she stood there before him in her rich fur cape,
looking at him with beautiful soft eyes, misty with unshed
tears.</p>

<p>"And I have known other things."</p>

<p>It relieved her heart to speak like this; his humility
gave her strength, as if she had accomplished some
proud and daring deed. She never had felt conscious of
her power and worldly glory in the presence of her beloved,
but now the memory of her obscure martyrdom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
her poverty and hunger, created in her heart a feeling
of real superiority over him she believed invincible.</p>

<p>"But I have no fear of suffering," she said, remembering
the words he had spoken once: "Tell me you do
not fear to suffer.... I believe your soul capable of
bearing all the sorrow of the world." And her hand
stole up to his cheek and caressed it, and he understood
that she had answered those words spoken long ago.</p>

<p>He was silent, as intoxicated as if she had presented
to his lips the very essence of her heart pressed out into
that crystal cup like the blood of the grape. He waited
for her to go on.</p>

<p>They reached a crossroads where stood a miserable
hut, falling into ruin. La Foscarina stopped to look at
it. The rude, unhinged windows were held open by a
stick laid across them. The low sun struck the smoked
walls within, and revealed the furniture&mdash;a table, a
bench, a cradle.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Stelio," said La Foscarina, "that
inn at Dolo where we waited for the train. Vampa's
inn, I mean. A great fire burned on the hearth, the
dishes glittered on the shelves, and slices of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">polenta</i> were
toasting on the gridiron. Twenty years ago everything
was exactly the same&mdash;the same fire, the same
dishes, the same <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">polenta</i>. My mother and I used to go
in there after the performance, and sit on the bench
before a table. I had wept, cried, raved, and had died
of poison or by the sword, on the stage. I still heard
in my ears the resonance of the verses I had uttered, in
a voice that was not my own, and a strange will still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
possessed my soul, and I could not shake it off&mdash;it was
as if another person, struggling with my inertness, persisted
in performing over again those movements and
actions. The simulation of an outside life remained in
the muscles of my face, and some evenings I could not
calm them. Already, even then, the mask, the sensation
of the living mask, was beginning to grow. My
eyes would remain fixed, and a chill crept at the roots
of my hair. I had difficulty in recovering full consciousness
of myself and my surroundings.</p>

<p>"The odors from the kitchen sickened me; the food
on our plates seemed too coarse, heavy as a stone, impossible
to swallow. My disgust at everything sprang
from something indescribably delicate and precious, of
which I was conscious under all my weariness&mdash;a vague
feeling of nobility beneath my humiliation. I hardly
know how to express it. Perhaps it was the obscure
presence of that power which later developed in me, of
that election, of that difference wherewith Nature has
marked me. Sometimes the consciousness of that difference
from others became so strong that it almost raised
a barrier between my mother and myself&mdash;God forgive
me!&mdash;almost separated me from her. A great loneliness
possessed me; nothing around me had power to touch
me any more. I was alone with my destiny. My
mother, even though she was with me, gradually receded
into an infinite distance. Ah, she was to die soon,
and was already preparing to leave me, and perhaps
this withdrawal was the forerunner. She used to urge
me to eat, with the words only she knew how to say.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
I answered: 'Wait! Wait!' I could only drink; I had
a great craving for cold water. At times, when I was
more tired and trembling than usual, I smiled a long-continued
smile. And even that dear woman herself,
with her deep heart, could not understand whence came
my smile!</p>

<p>"Incomparable hours, wherein it seemed that the
bodily prison was being broken through by the soul
that wandered to the extremest limits of life! What must
your youth have been, Stelio! Who can imagine it?
We have all felt the weight of sleep that descends upon
us after fatigue or intoxication, heavy and sudden as
a stroke from a hammer, and it seems to annihilate us.
But the power of dreams sometimes seizes upon us in
waking hours with the same force; it holds us and we
cannot resist it, though the whole thread of our existence
seems on the point of being destroyed. Ah, some
of the beautiful things you said that night in Venice
come back to my mind, when you spoke of her marvelous
hands weaving her own lights and shadows in a
continuous work of beauty. You alone know how to
describe the indescribable.</p>

<p>"Well, ... on that bench, in front of that rustic
table, in Vampa's inn at Dolo, where destiny led me
again with you, I had the most extraordinary visions
that dreams ever have called up in my brain. I saw that
which is unforgettable; I saw the real forms around me
obliterated by the dream-figures born of my instinct
and my thoughts. Under my fixed eyes, dazzled and
scorched by the smoky petroleum lamps of the improvised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
stage, the world of my expression began to throb
with life. The first lines of my art were developed in
that state of anguish, of weariness, fever, disgust, in
which my sensibility became, so to speak, plastic, after
the manner of the incandescent material we saw the
workmen holding at the end of the tube. In it was a
natural aspiration to be modeled, to receive breath, to
fill a mold. On certain evenings, in that wall covered
with copper utensils, I could see myself reflected as in
a mirror, in attitudes of grief or rage; with an unrecognizable
face; and, in order to escape from this hallucination,
to break the fixity of my gaze, I opened and shut
my eyes rapidly. My mother would say, over and over:
'Eat, my daughter, at least eat this.' But what were
bread, wine, meat, fruits, all those heavy things, in comparison
with what I had within me? I said to her:
'Wait!' and when we rose to go, I used to take only a
large piece of bread with me. I liked to eat it in the
country the next morning, under a tree, or sitting on
the bank of the Brenta.... Oh, those statues! They
did not recognize me the other day, Stelio, but I recognized
them!</p>

<p>"It was in the month of March, I remember. I went
out into the country very early with my bread. I walked
at random, though I meant to go to the statues. I went
from one to another, and stopped before every one, as
if I were paying a visit. Some appeared very beautiful
to me, and I tried to imitate their poses. But I remained
longer with the mutilated ones, as if to console them.
In the evening, on the stage, I remembered some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
them while I was acting, and with so deep a feeling of
their distance and their solitude that I felt as if I could
not speak any more. The audience would grow impatient
at these pauses too prolonged. At times, when
I had to wait for my companion in the scene to finish
his tirade, I used to stand in the attitude of one of those
statues, and remain as motionless as if I had been made
of stone. I was already beginning to carve my own
destiny.</p>

<p>"I loved one of them tenderly; it had lost its arms,
which once balanced a basket of fruit on its head. But
the hands still remained attached to the basket, and the
sight of them always aroused my pity. This statue
stood on its pedestal in a flax-field; a little canal of stagnant
water was near it, in which the reflected sky repeated
the tender blue of the flowers. And always, since
that time, in my most glowing moments on the stage,
visions of some landscape rise in my memory, particularly
when by the mere force of silence I succeed in
producing a thrill in the listening throng."</p>

<p>Her cheeks had flushed a little, and as the sun
wrapped her in a radiant garment, drawing sparkles from
her furs and from the crystal cup, her animation seemed
like an increase of light.</p>

<p>"What a spring that was! In one of my wandering
journeys I saw a great river for the first time. It appeared
to me suddenly, swollen, and flowing rapidly between
two wild banks. I felt then how much of divinity
there is in a great stream running through the earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
It was the Adige, flowing down from Verona, from the
city of Juliet."</p>

<p>An ambiguous emotion filled her heart while she recalled
the poverty and poetry of her youth. She was
impelled to continue, though she did not know how she
had arrived at these confidences, when she had intended
to speak to her friend of another young life, not belonging
to the past, but to the present. By what surprise
of love had she been turned from an effort of her will,
from her firm decision to face the painful truth, from
the concentration of her slumbering energy to linger in
the memory of the past, and to cover with the image of
her own lost virgin self that other image which was so
different?</p>

<p>"We reached Verona one evening in May. I was devoured
by anxiety. I clasped close to my heart the book
in which I had copied the lines of Juliet, and continually
repeated to myself the words of my first entrance: 'How
now? Who calls? I am here. What is your will?' My
imagination was excited by a strange coincidence: on
that very day I was fourteen years old&mdash;the age of
Juliet. The Nurse's gossip sounded in my ears; and,
little by little, my own destiny seemed mingled with
that of the Veronese. At the corner of every street I
thought I could see a throng approaching me, accompanying
a coffin covered with white roses. When I saw
the Arche degli Scaligeri behind its iron bars, I cried
to my mother, 'Here is Juliet's tomb!' And I burst into
sobs, and had a desperate desire to love and to die. 'O
thou too early seen unknown, and known too late!'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Her voice, repeating the immortal words, penetrated
the heart of her lover like a heart-rending melody. She
paused a moment, then repeated:</p>

<p>"Too late!"</p>

<p>They were the ominous words spoken by her lover,
which she herself had repeated in the garden, when both
were on the brink of being swept away on the flood of
their passion: "It is late; too late!" The woman that
was no longer young now faced the former image of
herself, in her maidenhood, throbbing in the form of
Juliet before her first dream of love. Having reached
the limit of experience, had she not at the same time
preserved the dream intact&mdash;but to what purpose? If
to-day she looked at the image of her far-distant youth, it
was only to trample upon it in leading her beloved to
the other woman, to her who lived and waited.</p>

<p>With her smile of inimitable sadness, she said:</p>

<p>"I <em>was</em> Juliet! One Sunday in May, in the immense
arena in the amphitheater under the open sky, before an
audience that had breathed in the legend of love and
death, I was Juliet herself. No thrill from the most responsive
audience, no applause, no triumph, ever has
had from me the fulness and intoxication of that unique
hour. Actually, when I heard Romeo say: 'O, she doth
teach the torches to burn bright,' my whole being
kindled. With great economy, I had managed to buy a
large bunch of roses, and these were my only ornament.
I mingled the roses with my words, my gestures, with
every attitude. I dropped one at Romeo's feet when we
first met; I strewed the petals of another on his head,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
as I stood on the balcony; and I covered his body with
them as he lay in the tomb. The words came with the
strangest ease, almost involuntarily, as in delirium, and
I could feel the throbbing in my veins accompanying
them.</p>

<p>"I could see the great amphitheater, half in sunlight,
half in shadow, and in the lighter part a sparkling from
thousands of eyes. The day was as calm as this. Not
a breath of air disturbed the folds of my robes, or the
hair that floated on my uncovered neck. I felt my
strength and animation momentarily increasing. How
I spoke of the lark and the nightingale! I had heard
them both a thousand times in the country. I knew all
their songs of the woods, the meadows, and the sky.
Every word, as it left my lips, seemed to have been
steeped in the warmth of my blood. There was no fiber
in me that did not give forth harmonious sound. Ah,
the grace, the state of grace! Every time it is given to
me to rise to the highest summit of my art I live again
in that indescribable <em>abandon</em>. Yes, I was Juliet! I cried
out in terror at the approach of dawn. The breeze
stirred my hair. I could feel the extraordinary silence
on which my lamentation fell. The multitude seemed to
have sunk into the ground. I spoke of the terror of the
coming day, but already I felt in reality 'the mask of
night upon my face.' Romeo had descended. We were
already dead; already both had entered the vale of shadows.
Do you remember? My eyes sought the fading
light of the sky. The people were noisy in the arena;
they were impatient for the death scene; they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
listen no more to the mother, the nurse, or the friar.
The quiver of that impatience quickened my throbbing
heart. The tragedy swept on. I recall the odor of the
pitch from the funeral torches, and of the roses that covered
me, and I remember the sound of far-off bells, and
of the sky that was losing its light, little by little, as
Juliet was losing her life, and a star, the first star, that
swam in my eyes with my tears. When I fell dead on
Romeo's body, the cry of the multitude in the shadows
was so violent that I was frightened. Some one lifted
me and dragged me toward that cry. Some one held
the torch close to my tear-stained face, which must have
been the color of death.... And thus, Stelio, one night
in May, Juliet came to life again, and appeared before
the people of Verona."</p>

<p>Again she paused, and closed her eyes as if she were
dizzy, but her sorrowful lips still smiled at her friend.</p>

<p>"And then? Then came the need to move, to go no
matter where, to traverse space, to breathe in the wind.
My mother followed me in silence. We crossed a bridge,
walked beside the Adige, and went on and on. My
mother asked at times where we were going. I wished
to find the Franciscan convent where Juliet's tomb was
hidden, since, to my great regret, she was not buried
in one of those beautiful tombs behind the great iron
gates. But I did not wish to say so, and I could not
speak. My voice seemed to have been lost with the
last word of the dying Juliet. 'Where are we going?'
again asked that indefatigable kindness. Ah, then the
last word of Juliet came to me in reply. We were again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
near the Adige, beside a bridge. I think I began to
run, because soon afterward I felt myself seized by my
mother's arms, and I stood leaning against the parapet,
choking with sobs. 'There let me die!' I wished to say,
but could not. The river carried with it the night and
all its stars. I felt that the desire to die was not mine
alone. Ah, blessed mother!"</p>

<p>She became very pale; her whole heart felt once more
the embrace of those arms, the kiss of those lips, those
tender tears, the depth of that suffering.</p>

<p>With a mingled feeling of surprise and alarm, Stelio
watched the great waves of life that passed over her,
the extraordinary expressions, the alternating lights and
shadows; but he dared not speak, dared not break in
upon the occult workings of that great, unhappy soul.
He could only feel confusedly in her words the beauty
and sadness of things unexpressed.</p>

<p>"Speak to me still," he said. "Draw nearer to me,
sweet soul! No moment since I first loved you has been
worth the steps that we have taken together to-day."</p>

<p>Again her first sudden question returned to her mind:
"Do you think often of Donatella?"</p>

<p>A short path led to the Fondamenta degli Angeli,
whence the lagoon could be seen, smooth and luminous.</p>

<p>"How beautiful that light is!" she said. "It is like
that night when my name was still Perdita, Stelio."</p>

<p>She now touched a note that she had touched in an
interrupted prelude.</p>

<p>"The last night of September," she added. "Do you
remember?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Her heart was filled with exaltation to such a degree
that she almost feared it would fail her. But she resolved
that her voice should utter firmly the name that
must break the silence between her friend and herself.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the ship anchored before the
gardens? A salute greeted the flag as it slid down the
mast. Our gondola touched the ship as we passed under
its shadow."</p>

<p>A moment's pause. Her pallor was animated by a
wonderful vitality.</p>

<p>"Then, in that shadow, you first spoke Donatella's
name."</p>

<p>She made a new effort, as a swimmer, submerged by a
wave, rises again and shakes his head free of the foam.</p>

<p>"She began then to be yours!"</p>

<p>She felt as if she were growing rigid from head to
foot. Her eyes stared fixedly at the glittering water.</p>

<p>"She must be yours," she said at last, with the sternness
of necessity in her voice, as if to repel with a second
shock the terrible things that were ready to surge up from
her fiery heart.</p>

<p>Seized by sudden anguish, incapable of interrupting
by a word the lightning-like apparitions of her tragic
soul, Stelio halted, and laid his hand on his companion's
arm to make her stop also.</p>

<p>"Is it not true?" she asked with a sweetness almost
calm, as if her tension had suddenly relaxed, and her
passion had quietly accepted the yoke laid upon it by
her will. "Speak! I do not fear to suffer. Let us sit
down here. I am a little tired."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>They sat down on a low wall, facing the water.</p>

<p>"What can I say to you?" said the young man in a
stifled voice, after a pause, unable to overcome the agitation
arising from the certainty of his present love and
the consciousness of his desires, inexorable as fate. "Perhaps
what you have imagined is true; perhaps it is only
a fancy of your own mind. I am certain to-day of only
one thing, and that is that I love you and recognize
in you all that is noble. I know one other thing that
is noble&mdash;that I have a work to do and a life to live according
to the dictates of Nature. You, too, must remember.
On that September evening I spoke to you a
long time of my life and of the genii that are leading it
to its final destiny. You know that I can renounce
nothing."</p>

<p>He trembled as if he held in his hand a sharp weapon,
with which, as he was compelled to move it, he could
not avoid wounding the defenseless woman.</p>

<p>"No, nothing; and especially your love, which ceaselessly
exalts my strength and my hope. But did you not
promise me more than love? Can you not do for me
things that love alone cannot do? Do you not desire
to be the constant inspiration of my life and my work?"</p>

<p>She listened motionless, with fixed eyes.</p>

<p>"It is true," he continued, after an anxious pause, recovering
his courage, and feeling that on the sincerity
of this moment depended the fate of that free alliance
whereby he had hoped to be broadened, not confined.
"It is true; that evening, when I saw you descend the
stairs in the midst of the throng in company with her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
who had sung, I believed that a secret thought guided
you from the moment that you did not come alone to
meet me."</p>

<p>The woman felt a chill run through the roots of her
hair. Her fingers trembled round the crystal cup, wherein
the colors of sky and water were blended.</p>

<p>"I believed that you yourself had chosen her. Your
look was that of one who knows and foresees. I was
struck by it."</p>

<p>By her keen torture, the woman realized how sweet
a falsehood would have been. She wished that he would
either lie or be silent. She measured the distance that
lay between her and the canal&mdash;the water that swallows
and lulls to sleep.</p>

<p>"There was something about her that was hostile to
me. She remained to me obscure, incomprehensible.
Do you remember the way she disappeared? Her image
faded, and only the desire of her song remained. You
yourself, who led her to me, have more than once revived
the remembrance of her. You have seen her
shadow even where she was not."</p>

<p>She saw Death itself. No other wound had gone
deeper, had hurt her so cruelly.&mdash;I alone! I alone have
brought it on myself!&mdash;And she remembered the cry
that had brought this misery: "Go! She awaits you!"
Suddenly the internal tempest seemed to become a mere
hallucination. She thought herself non-existent, and
wondered to see the glass shining in her hand; she lost
all corporeal sense. All that had happened was only
a trick of the imagination. Her name was Perdita. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
dead Summer was lying in the depths of the lagoon.
Words were words, that was all.</p>

<p>"Could I love her? Were I to see her again, should
I desire to turn her destiny toward mine? Perhaps. But
of what use would that be? And of what use would all
the vicissitudes and necessities of life be against the
faith that links us? Could you and I resemble commonplace
lovers who pass their days in quarreling, weeping,
and cursing?"</p>

<p>The woman gnashed her teeth. She had a wild instinct
to defend herself, and to hurt him as in a hopeless
struggle. A murderous desire flashed across her maddened
brain.</p>

<p>&mdash;No, you shall not have her!&mdash;And the brutality of
her tyrant seemed monstrous to her. Under the measured
and repeated blows, she felt that she was like a
man she had once seen on the dusty road of a mining
town, prostrated by repeated blows on his head from
a mallet in his enemy's hand. That hideous memory
mingled with her mental torture. She sprang up, impelled
by the savage force that filled her being. The
glass broke in her convulsed hand, cut her, fell in a
sparkling shower at her feet.</p>

<p>Stelio startled. The woman's motionless silence had
deceived him, but now he looked at her and saw her
at last; and once more he saw, as on that night in her
room when the logs had crackled on the hearth, the expression
of madness on her agitated face. He stammered
some words of regret, but impatience boiled under his
concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," said La Foscarina, mastering her agony with a
bitterness that convulsed her mouth, "how strong I am!
Another time have a care that your wounds are not made
so slowly, since my resistance is so slight, my friend."</p>

<p>She saw that blood was dripping from her fingers;
she wrapped them in her handkerchief. She looked at
the sparkling fragments on the grass.</p>

<p>"The cup is broken! You had praised it too highly.
Shall we raise a mausoleum for it here?"</p>

<p>She was very bitter, almost mocking, her lips opening
slightly to utter a mirthless laugh. Stelio stood silent,
chagrined, his heart full of rancor at beholding the destruction
of so beautiful an effort as that perfect cup.</p>

<p>"Let us imitate Nero, since we have already imitated
Xerxes!"</p>

<p>She felt even more keenly than he the harshness of
her sarcasm, the insincerity of her voice, the malignity
of the laugh that was like a muscular spasm. But she
was unable to conquer her soul at that moment. She
felt a bitter, irresistible necessity to scorn, to devastate,
to trample under foot, invaded by a sort of perfidious
demon. Every vestige of tenderness and benevolence
had vanished, every hope, every illusion. The bitter
hatred that lurks under the love of ardent natures was
dominant. On the man's face she could discern the same
shadow that darkened her own.</p>

<p>"Do I irritate you? Do you wish to return to Venice
alone? Would you like to leave the dying season behind
you? The tide is falling, but there is always enough
water for one who has no intention of returning. Would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
it suit you to have me try it? Am I not as docile as
you could wish?"</p>

<p>She said these insensate things in a hissing tone, and
became almost livid, as if suddenly burned by some corroding
poison. And Stelio remembered having seen the
same mask on her face on a distant day of love, madness
and sadness. His heart contracted, then softened.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I have hurt you, I ask for pardon," he said,
trying to take her hand and soothe her by a gentle act.
"But did we not begin together to approach this matter?
Was it not you that"&mdash;</p>

<p>She interrupted him, exasperated by his gentleness.</p>

<p>"Hurt me? And what does that matter? Have no
pity, no pity! Do not weep over the beautiful eyes of
the wounded hare!"</p>

<p>The words broke between her teeth. Her contracted
lips opened in a convulsion of wild laughter that was
like heart-rending sobs. Her companion shuddered, spoke
to her in a low tone, aware of the curious eyes of the
women who sat at the thresholds of their cabins.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself! Calm yourself! Oh, Foscarina, I beg
of you! Do not act so, I entreat! We shall soon be
at the quay, and then we shall go home. I will tell you&mdash;You
will understand me then. Come, now we are in
the street. Do you hear me?"</p>

<p>He feared she would fall in her hysterical convulsion,
and stood ready to support her. But she only walked
faster, unable to speak, smothering that wild laughter
with her bandaged hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"What ails you? What do you see?" Stelio inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p>Never could he forget the change in those eyes. They
were dull, staring, sightless, yet they seemed to see something
that was not there; they were filled with an unknown
vision, occupied by some monstrous image which
without doubt had generated that mad and anguished
laughter.</p>

<p>"Shall we stop here a little while? Would you like
some water?"</p>

<p>They found themselves now on the Fondamenta dei
Vetrai. How long was it since they had walked beside
the stagnant canal? How much of their life had vanished
in the interval? What profound shadow were
they leaving behind them?</p>

<p>Having descended into the gondola, and wrapped herself
in her cloak, La Foscarina tried to control her hysteria,
holding her face with both hands, but from time
to time the terrible laugh would escape; then she pressed
her hands closer to her mouth, as if she were trying to
suffocate herself.</p>

<p>The lagoon and the deep twilight obliterated all forms
and colors; only the rows of posts, like a file of monks
on a path of ashes, showed against the dark background.
When the bells began their clamor, her soul remembered,
her tears gushed forth; the horror was vanquished.</p>

<p>She took her hands from her face, leaned toward her
friend's shoulder, and found again her voice in saying:</p>

<p>"Forgive me!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
CASSANDRA'S REINCARNATION</h2>


<p>She humbled herself with shame. From that day
every action of her silently begged for pardon
and oblivion.</p>

<p>A new grace seemed born within her. She became
more cheerful, spoke more gently, walked softly
about the house dressed in quiet colors, veiling her beautiful
eyes with the deep shadow of her lashes, because
she dared not look at her friend. The fear of tiring him,
of displeasing or boring him, gave her the wings of divination.
Her ever watchful sensibility listened at the
inaccessible door of his dreams.</p>

<p>Her spirit, determined to create a new feeling capable
of conquering the violence of instinct, revealed
in her face with marvelous signs the difficulty of her
task. Never before had her supreme art found expressions
so singular. Looking at her one day, Stelio spoke
to her of the infinite power concentrated in the shadow
produced by the helmet on the face of <cite>Il Pensieroso</cite>.</p>

<p>"Michelangelo," he said, "has, in a small cavity in the
marble, concentrated all the effort of human meditation.
Just as the stream fills a hollowed palm, so the eternal
mystery that surrounds us fills the small space made by
the Titan's chisel in the material from the mountains;
and there it has remained, growing denser through all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the centuries. I know only the mobile shadow of your
face, Fosca, that equals that shadow in intensity, and
sometimes even surpasses it."</p>

<p>Eager for poetry and knowledge, she yearned for the
Inspirer's presence. She became for him the ideal figure
of one that listens and understands. The strange, unique
arrangement of her hair suggested fluttering, impatient
wings round her pure forehead.</p>

<p>She read aloud to him pages from the sovereign poets.
The august form of the Book seemed magnified by the
attitude she assumed in holding it, by her way of turning
the pages, by her religious gravity of attention, and
the harmony of the voice that changed the printed symbols
into vocal cadences. While reading Dante, she was
as severe and noble as the sibyls in the dome of the
Sistine Chapel, sustaining the weight of the sacred volumes
with all the heroism of their bodies moved by
the breath of prophecy.</p>

<p>When the last syllable had been spoken, she saw Stelio
rise impetuously, feverishly, and roam about the rooms,
stirred by the dart of the god, panting in the excitement
roused by the confused tumult of his own creative force.
Sometimes he approached her with glowing eyes transfigured
by a sudden beatitude, kindled by an inner
flame, as if an immortal truth had just been revealed.
With a shudder that drove away from her heart the
memory of every caress, she saw him lay his head upon
her knees, overwhelmed by the tremendous struggle he
carried on within himself, by the shock that accompanied
some hidden metamorphosis. She suffered, yet she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
happy, though she knew not whether he too suffered or
was happy; her heart was filled with pity, fear, and reverence
to feel that vigorous form laboring thus in the
genesis of the idea. She kept silence; she waited, adoring
that head that lay upon her knees, filled with thoughts
unrevealed.</p>

<p>But she comprehended his great emotion better when
one day, after she had been reading to him, he spoke
of the exile of Dante.</p>

<p>"Imagine, Fosca, if you can without bewilderment,
the transport and ardor of that great soul, when uniting
itself with elementary energies in order to conceive his
words! Imagine Alighieri, his mind already filled with
his incomparable vision, on the way to exile, an implacable
pilgrim, driven by his passion and his poverty
from country to country, from refuge to refuge, across
plains, over mountains, beside rivers and seas, in all seasons,
suffocated by the sweetness of spring, shivering
under the harshness of winter, always alert, attentive,
with wide, voracious eyes, anxious with the inner travail
whereby his gigantic work was formed. Imagine
the fulness of that soul in the contrast between common
necessities and the flaming apparitions that rose
suddenly before him at a turn in the road, on the bank
of a stream, from a hollow in the rocks, on the slope
of a hill, in the depths of the forest, or in a meadow
where the larks were singing. By means of his senses,
life multiform and multiplex poured into his spirit, transfiguring
into living images the abstract ideas that filled
his brain. The sound, the appearance, and the essence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of the very elements themselves entered into his occult
labor, developing it with voices, lines, color, movement,
and with innumerable mysteries. Fire, air, earth, and
water worked in collaboration at the sacred poem, penetrated
the sum of its doctrine, warmed it, aërated it,
watered it, covered it with leaves and flowers. Open
this Christian book, and imagine at the same time the
face of a Greek god. Do you not see, springing from
both, shadows and light, the flashes or the wind from
the heavens?"</p>

<p>She began to feel that her own life was becoming one
with the all-absorbing work, that her own personal self
was entering, drop by drop, into the personage of the
drama, that her look, her poses, her gestures and voice
were going to the composing of the figure of the heroine
"living beyond life." She fancied that she was dissolving
into her elements in the fire of that other intellect,
only to be re-formed by the necessity of a heroism that
should dominate Fate.</p>

<p>Sometimes it seemed to her that she was losing her
human sincerity, and that she would always remain in
the state of fictitious excitement into which she threw
herself while studying a tragic rôle she was to create.
Thus she experienced a new torment. She tried to shut
and contract her soul under his keen glance, as if
to prevent his intellect from penetrating her mind and
robbing her of her secret life. She grew afraid of the
seer.&mdash;He will read in my soul the silent words that he
will put in the mouth of his creation, and I shall only
speak them on the stage, under my mask.&mdash;Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
she felt a sudden need to break the spell, to withdraw
from the image that was to be like her, to spoil those
lines of beauty, which forced her to a determined sacrifice.
Was there not also in the tragedy a maiden thirsting
for love and eager for joy, a maiden in whom a great
mind recognized the living incarnation of his most exquisite
dream, the Victory that was to crown his life?
And was there not also an impassioned woman no longer
young, who had one foot already in the dark shadow,
and who had but a few steps more to take in order to
disappear? More than once she was tempted to contradict
her seeming resignation by some violent act.
Then, like a penitent, she redoubled her fervor to ward
off the peril, hardened herself to discipline, sharpened
her vigilance, repeating with a sort of intoxication the
act of supreme renunciation that had risen from the
depths of her sadness at the aspect of the purifying
flame.&mdash;You must have all; I shall be content with seeing
you live, seeing your joy. And do with me as you
will!&mdash;</p>

<p>Then Stelio loved her for the unexpected visions she
brought him. He trembled and turned pale one day
when she entered the room with her soft step, her face
fixed in calm sorrow, as if she were emerging from
depths of wisdom whence all human agitations seem
but a puff of wind on a dusty road.</p>

<p>"Ah, at last! I have created you! I have created
you!" he cried, thinking he saw his heroine herself standing
on a threshold of the distant chamber filled with
treasure taken from the tombs of the Atrides. "Stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
still a moment! Do not move your eyelids&mdash;keep your
eyes motionless, as if they were petrified! Now you are
blind. But you can see things that others do not see,
and nothing can be hidden from you. Here in this place
the man you love has declared his love to another, who
trembles at the revelation. They are still here, they
have just let go each other's hands, and their love
quivers in the air. The room is full of funeral treasure,
and on two tables are laid out the riches that covered
the bodies of Agamemnon and Cassandra. There are
the coffers filled with necklaces, and there are the urns
full of ashes. The balcony looks out upon the plain
of Argos and on the distant mountains. It is twilight,
and all that terrible gold glitters in the creeping shadows.
Do you understand? And you are there, on the threshold,
led by the nurse. You are blind, yet nothing is
hidden from you. Stop a moment!"</p>

<p>He spoke in the sudden fever of invention. The
scene appeared before him, then disappeared, submerged
in a flood of poetry.</p>

<p>"What shall you do? What shall you say?"</p>

<p>The actress felt a chill at the roots of her hair. Her
very soul vibrated. She became blind and prophetic.
The cloud of Tragedy descended and hung over her
head.</p>

<p>"What shall you say? You will call them. You will
call both of them by name in that silence where the great
royal spoils repose."</p>

<p>The actress felt the coursing of her blood; her voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
was to resound through the silence of thousands of years,
to revive the ancient suffering of men and heroes.</p>

<p>"You will take their hands; you will feel their two
lives stretching toward each other."</p>

<p>The blindness of the immortal statues was in her
eyes. She could see herself sculptured in the great
silence, and feel the thrill of the mute throng, seized
with awe at the sublime power of her attitude.</p>

<p>"And then? And then?"</p>

<p>The Inspirer rushed impetuously toward the actress,
as if he wished to strike her in order to draw sparks
from her.</p>

<p>"You must awake Cassandra from her sleep; you must
feel her ashes revive in your hands; she must be present
in your mental vision. Will you? Do you understand?
Your living soul must touch her ancient soul, and blend
into one soul and one grief, so that the flight of time
seems annihilated. Cassandra is in you, and you are
in her. Have you not loved her, and do you not love
Priam's daughter also? Who that once shall hear it
can ever forget, who can ever forget the deep notes of
your voice and the convulsion of your lips at the first
cry of fatalistic fury: 'O Earth! O Apollo!' I see you
once more, deaf and dumb, on your chariot with the
look of a wild beast just captured. But among so many
terrible cries, some were infinitely sweet and sad. The
old men compared you to the nightingale. What were
the words you used when you spoke of your beautiful
river? And when the old men questioned you about the
love of the god&mdash;do you remember your answer?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tragic Muse palpitated as if the breath of the
god again invaded her. She had become ardent, ductile
material, subject to all the inspirations of the poet.</p>

<p>"Do you remember your answer?"</p>

<p>"O espousals, espousals of Paris, fatal to the beloved!
O you, paternal waters of the Scamandros! Once, on
your shores, my youth was nourished by you!"</p>

<p>"Ah, divine woman, your melody does not make one
regret the syllables of Æschylus! I remember. The
soul of the multitude, seized by the lamentation 'of discordant
sounds,' relaxed and was soothed by that melodious
sigh, and each of us received the vision of years
long past and our innocent happiness. You can say:
'I was Cassandra.' In speaking of her, you will remember
a former life. Her mask of gold will be in your
hands."</p>

<p>He seized both her hands; both were intent on the
flashes generated by their blended forces; the same electric
spark ran through their nerves.</p>

<p>"You are there, near the spoil of the slave-princess,
and you feel the mask. What shall you say?"</p>

<p>In the pause that followed, both seemed to be waiting
for a flash. The actress's eyes again became fixed
and blind, her face became like marble. The Inspirer
let go her hands, and they made the gesture of feeling
the sepulchral golden mask. In a voice that created the
tangible form, she said:</p>

<p>"How large her mouth is!"</p>

<p>"You see her, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I too can see her. The mouth is large; the terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
effort of prophecy dilated it; she cried aloud,
cursed, and lamented without ceasing. Can you imagine
her mouth in silence?"</p>

<p>Still in the same attitude, as if in ecstasy, she said
slowly:</p>

<p>"What profundity in her wonderful silence!"</p>

<p>She seemed to be repeating words suggested to her
by mysterious genii, and, while the poet listened to her,
he fancied that he himself had been about to speak
them. A profound tremor shook him, as if he were
witnessing a miracle.</p>

<p>"And her eyes?" he demanded, agitated. "Of what
color were her eyes?"</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>The marble lines of her face changed slightly, as if
under a wave of suffering. A furrow appeared between
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Her eyes," continued the revealer, "were as sweet
and sad as two violets."</p>

<p>She paused again, panting, as one who suffers in a
dream. Her lips were dry, her temples moist.</p>

<p>"Thus they were before they closed forever!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sometimes Stelio came to his friend's house breathless
and excited, as if pursued by an Erinni. La Foscarina
never questioned him, but her personality soothed
that restless spirit.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I am afraid of the vastness of my conceptions,"
he said. "I am afraid of being suffocated by
them. You believe me to be a little mad, do you not?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Do you remember that stormy evening when I returned
from the Lido? How sweet you were that evening!
A short time before that, standing on the Bridge of the
Rialto, I found a Motive. I had translated the words
of the Elements into notes. Do you know what a Motive
is? It is a small spring, from which may be born
many other springs, a tiny seed that may give birth to
a crown of forests; a little spark that may kindle an
endless chain of conflagration&mdash;a nucleus that produces
infinite force. A few days ago I began to develop the
Motive of that stormy evening, which I shall call the
Pipes of Æolus. Listen to it."</p>

<p>He went to the piano, and struck a few notes with
one hand.</p>

<p>"It contains no more than that, but you cannot
imagine the generating force of those few notes. A
tempest, a whirlwind of music has been born of them,
but I have not yet been able to master it. I am almost
vanquished, suffocated, constrained to fly."</p>

<p>He laughed a little; but his soul was swaying like the
sea.</p>

<p>"The Pipes of Prince Æolus, opened by the companions
of Ulysses. Do you remember it? The imprisoned
winds arise and push back their vessel, and the
men tremble with terror."</p>

<p>His spirit could not rest long, and nothing could divert
him from his mental work. He kissed his friend's
hand, paced to and fro, stopping before the piano that
Donatella had played when she sang Claudio's melody.
He wandered to the window, and gazed upon the leafless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
garden. His aspiration reached out toward the musical
creature, toward her that must chant his hymns at the
summit of his tragic symphonies.</p>

<p>In a low, clear voice the woman said:</p>

<p>"If Donatella were here with us!"</p>

<p>He turned, approached her, and gazed at her fixedly,
silently. She smiled her slight, mask-like smile at seeing
him so near her, yet so far removed. She felt that
he loved no one at that moment&mdash;not herself, not Donatella,
but that he regarded both simply as instruments
of his art, forces to employ, bows to bend. He was on
fire with poetry, and she, with her poor wounded heart,
her secret torture, her mute plea&mdash;she was there, intent
on nothing but her sacrifice, ready to pass beyond love
and life, as the heroine of the future drama. Meanwhile,
each day must make its mark on her face, discolor
her lips, fade her hair; each day, in the service of old
age, would hasten the work of destruction in her miserable
flesh. And then?</p>

<p>She recognized that it was love, after all, unquenchable
passion, that created all the illusions and all the
hopes which seemed to aid her in accomplishing "what
love alone cannot do."</p>

<p>She realized that the torturing restraint of those days
had not succeeded in creating in her even a symptom
of the new feeling whereby love was to be made sublime.
Her secret task, therefore, meant simply continual dissimulation.
Was it worth while to live for this?</p>

<p>If once the young man's madness and ardor had caused
her to suffer, she now suffered far more in seeing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
that ardor had grown calm, and that a sort of reserve
had taken its place&mdash;a reserve that sometimes repelled
the gentlest caress. She felt shame at her regret, knowing
that he was possessed by his great idea, and was
concentrating all his energies upon it. But a dark rancor
often mastered her in the evening, after he had departed,
and blind suspicions nightly tortured her sleepless soul.</p>

<p>&mdash;To go away!&mdash;The necessity to do this came suddenly,
urgently. She had said to her beloved once, on
a memorable day: "There is only one thing I can do&mdash;go
away, and leave you free with your fate. This thing
I can do, which love alone could not do." Henceforth,
delay was no longer possible; she must break off with
all hesitation, and emerge finally from that kind of fatal
suspension of movement, in which she had lived so long
in agitation.</p>

<p>Since that October dawn, their outward life had been
unchanged. Nevertheless, she felt that it was impossible
for her to continue to live in that way any longer.
She felt a consciousness of something fully accomplished,
as in the tree that has yielded all its fruit, as in the
river that has reached the sea.</p>

<p>Her courage revived; her soul grew stronger, her
energies awoke once more, and the virile qualities of the
leader again came to life. In a few days she had arranged
her professional route, reassembled her dramatic
company, and fixed the date of departure.&mdash;You must
go and work over there among the barbarians across
the ocean. You must wander still from town to town,
from hotel to hotel, from theater to theater, and every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
night you will draw howls from the crowd that pays
you. You will gain much money; you will return laden
with gold and with wisdom, unless it happens that you
are crushed by a wheel some misty day on a crowded
street. Who knows? From whom have you received
the order to depart? From some one within yourself&mdash;deep,
deep within you&mdash;who sees that which you cannot
see, like the blind woman in the tragedy. Who
knows whether over there, on one of those wide, peaceful
rivers, your soul will not find its harmony and your
lips will not learn that smile they have attempted so
many times in vain! Perhaps you will discover a few
white hairs and that smile in your mirror at the same
time!&mdash;</p>

<p>And she went on preparing for her journey.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
THE STORY OF THE ARCHORGAN</h2>


<p>From time to time a breath of Spring passed
across the February sky.</p>

<p>"Do you feel the Spring?" said Stelio to his
friend, inhaling deep breaths of the new air.</p>

<p>La Foscarina fell behind him a step or two, because
her resolute heart was weakening; she lifted her face
to the sky, now flecked with white clouds like floating
plumes. The raucous shriek of a siren whistle prolonged
itself in the estuary, becoming fainter by degrees until
the sound was as soft as the note of a flute. It seemed
to the woman that something rose from the depths of
her heart and escaped with that prolonged note, as a
poignant grief gradually changes into a tender memory.</p>

<p>"Yes, Spring has already arrived at the Tre Porti."</p>

<p>Once more they floated aimlessly along the lagoon,
that water as familiar to their thoughts as is the web
to the weaver.</p>

<p>"Did you say at the Tre Porti?" the young man
cried, enthusiastically, as if his soul were reawakened.
"It is there, near the lower bank, at the setting of the
moon, that the sailors take the Wind prisoner, and bring
it, chained, to Dardi Seguso. Some day I will tell you
the story of the Archorgan."</p>

<p>His air of mystery in describing the action of the
sailors made La Foscarina smile.</p>

<p>"What story?" she asked, enticed by his significant
tone. "And what does Seguso do here? Has the story
anything to do with the master glassblower?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but a master of a former day, who knew Latin
and Greek, music and architecture, who was admitted
to the Academy of the Pellegrini, whose gardens are at
Murano; he was often invited to sup with Titian in his
house in the Contrada dei Biri; was a friend of Bernardo
Cappello, of Jacopo Zane, and other ancient
Petrarchists. At Caterino Zeno's house he saw the famous
organ built for Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary,
and his magnificent idea came to him in the course
of a discussion with that Agostino Amadi who succeeded
in adding to his collection of instruments a true Grecian
lyre, a great Lesbian heptachord, rich with gold and
ivory. Ah, imagine it, that relic of the school of Mitylene,
brought to Venice by a galley which, in passing
through the waters of Santa Maura, caught and dragged
the body of Sappho as far as Malamocco, like an armful
of dead grass! But that, too, is another tale."</p>

<p>Again the nomad woman recovered her youthful spirits
enough to smile, pleased as a child to whom one shows
a picture-book. How many marvelous stories, how many
delightful fancies had not the Visionary conjured up
for her on those waters, during the long hours of the
afternoon? How many enchantments had he not known
how to weave for her, to the rhythm of the oar, in words
that made all things seem reality? How many times,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
seated beside her beloved in the light boat, had she not
enjoyed that sort of waking dream in which all cares
were banished, carried away on waves of poetry?</p>

<p>"Tell it to me," she begged.</p>

<p>She wished to add:&mdash;This story will be the last.&mdash;But
she restrained herself, because up to this time she had
not spoken to him of her fixed resolution.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"You are as eager for stories as Sofia."</p>

<p>At that name, as when she heard the name of Spring,
she felt her resolution weaken; the cruelty of her fate
pierced her heart, and her whole being turned with
yearning toward her escaping happiness.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said, pointing to the mirror-like lagoon,
rippled here and there by a light breeze. "Do not those
infinite lines of silence aspire to become music?"</p>

<p>Silvery-white in the calm afternoon, the estuary seemed
to bear the islets on its breast as lightly as the softest
clouds hung from the sky.</p>

<p>"Well, the master glassblower heard at Zeno's house
praises of the famous organ of the King of Hungary,
and cried: '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Corpo di Bacco!</i> You shall see what an organ
I will build, with my stick, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liquida musa canente!</i> I will
make the god of organs! <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dant sonitum glaucæ per stagna
loquacia cannæ.</i> The waters of the lagoon shall give it its
tone, and in it the stones, the buoys, and the fish also
shall sing. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Multisonum silentium.</i> You shall see, by the
body of Diana!' All his hearers laughed, save Giulia
da Ponte&mdash;because she had black teeth! And the Sansovino
gave a dissertation on hydraulic organs. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
boaster, before taking his leave, invited the company to
hear his new music on the day of the Sensa, and promised
that the Doge on his Bucentaur should halt in the
middle of the lagoon to listen. That evening the news
that Dardi Seguso had lost his senses spread to Venice,
and the Council, which had a tender regard for its famous
workmen, sent a messenger to Murano to learn the truth
about the report. The messenger found the artisan with
his sweetheart, Perdilanza, who was very loving to him
because she was anxious, and feared that Dardi was insane.
The master, after looking at the messenger with
fiery eyes, burst into a hearty laugh, which reassured
her as to his state of mind; then, quite calm again, Seguso
ordered the messenger to report to the Council
that, on the day of the Sensa, Venice, San Marco, the
Grand Canal, and the Palace of the Doges should possess
yet another miracle. On the following day, he made a
formal request for the possession of one of the five little
islets that circled Murano like the satellites of a planet,
but have now disappeared, or have dwindled to mere
sandbanks. After exploring the waters around Temòdia,
Trencòre, Galbaia, Mortesina, and La Folèga, he chose
Temòdia as one chooses a bride, and Perdilanza entered
the shadow of affliction. Look, Fosca; perhaps even now
we are passing over the memory of Temòdia. The organ-pipes
are sunk deep in the mud, but they never will
decay. There are seven thousand of them. We are passing
over the ruins of a forest of melodious glass. How
delicate the seaweed is here!"</p>

<p>"Tell me the reason why Perdilanza entered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
shadow of affliction," said La Foscarina, as both leaned
over and looked deep into the beautiful clear waters.</p>

<p>"Because her name had been driven from the lips and
the heart of her lover by the name of Temòdia, which
he constantly uttered with vehement ardor, and because
the island was the only place to which she might not
follow him. There he had constructed his new work-rooms,
and there he stayed the greater part of the day,
and almost all night, assisted by his workmen, whom
he had bound to silence by a solemn oath before the altar.
The Council, in ordering that the master should be provided
with everything necessary for his tremendous task,
had decreed that he should lose his head should his
work prove inferior to his proud boast. Then Dardi
tied a scarlet thread around his bare neck."</p>

<p>La Foscarina felt as if she were in a dream. Stelio
seemed to have been speaking of himself in those strange
figures of speech, as on that last night of September
when he had explained the myth of the pomegranate,
and the name of the imaginary woman began with the
first two syllables of the name he had given her in those
days! Was any personal significance veiled behind this
story? Why had he, deliberately, in the vicinity of the
place where she had been seized with that terrible
laughter, called up, by that fanciful tale, the memory of
the broken vase? In trying to understand, she made
for herself an instrument of torture, with the dream-fancies
of Stelio's brain. She did not remember that
as yet he was ignorant of her approaching departure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Instinctively she said within herself:&mdash;I am going far-away;
do not wound me.&mdash;</p>

<p>She wished to hear the remainder of the story, however,
for she longed to understand him fully.</p>

<p>"Well, what happened then to the man with the scarlet
thread?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"More than once he felt his head was insecure on his
shoulders," Stelio replied laughingly. "He had to blow
pipes as large as the trunk of a tree, and he had to do
it with his own mouth, unaided by bellows. He blew
and blew with all his might, without ceasing. Fancy
it! The lungs of a Cyclops would hardly be strong
enough for that. Ah, some day I shall describe the
fever of that existence hanging between the ax and the
production of a miracle, in colloquy with the elements.
He had Fire, Water, and Earth, but lacked Air&mdash;the
movement of the Air. But every day the Council of
Ten sent to him a red-haired man to wish him good
morning&mdash;you know, that red-haired man, with a cap
over his eyes, who embraces the column in the <cite>Adoration
of the Magi</cite> of the second Bonifazio. After colossal labors,
Seguso had a brilliant idea. He found a magician,
who was said to have power over the Wind in favor of
long navigations. He said to the wizard: 'I need a
little wind, not too light nor too strong, but steady and
gentle, which I could manage as I wish: only a little
breeze with which to blow some glass that I have in my
head. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lenius aspirans aura secunda venit.</i> Do you understand,
old man?'"</p>

<p>The story-teller burst into a ringing laugh, for he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
fancy the scene with all its details in a house on the
Calle della Testa, at San Zanepolo, where the Schiavone
lived with his daughter.</p>

<p>La Foscarina tried to join in his gayety; but his boyish
laughter pained her as it had once before when she
was lost in the labyrinth.</p>

<p>"It is a long story," Stelio went on. "Some day I
shall use it, but I am keeping it for a time when I have
more leisure. Now fancy! The magician works the
spell. Every night Dardi sent his sailors to the Tre
Porti to spread a snare for the little Wind. At last, one
night, or rather just before dawn, when the moon was
about to set, they caught it asleep on a sandy bank in
the midst of a flock of tired swallows it had borne
thither.</p>

<p>"There it lay, on its back, breathing as lightly as a
child in the salty aroma of the waters, almost covered
by innumerable little forked tails. The rising tide rocked
it in its slumber, and the black-and-white travelers fluttered
about it, weary with their long flight."</p>

<p>"What a charming fancy!" exclaimed La Foscarina
at this fresh picture. "Where have you seen that?"</p>

<p>"Here begins the real charm of the story," he answered.
"They seize the sleeping Wind, bind it with
osier withes, carry it aboard their boat, and set sail for
Temòdia. The bark is invaded by the flock of swallows,
which will not abandon the leader of their flight."</p>

<p>Stelio paused, because the details of the fantasy
crowded his imagination to such a degree that he knew
not which to choose to relate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then?" urged his companion, with interest.</p>

<p>"I can tell no more now, Fosca. I know too many
things.... Well, imagine that Dardi falls in
love with his prisoner. It is called Ornitio, because it
leads flights of migrating birds. A continual twittering
of swallows surrounds Temòdia; nests hang from the
posts and the scaffolding that surround the great structure;
wings are singed in the flames of the furnace,
when Ornitio blows through the tube to create a light
and luminous column with that ball of burning paste.
But before he had tamed it and taught it what to do,
he had much trouble with it. The Master of the Flame
began by speaking Latin to it, and reciting lines of Virgil
to it, believing it would understand. But the azure-haired
Ornitio spoke Greek, naturally, with a slightly
sibilant accent. It knew Sappho's odes by heart, and
while it breathed through the unequal tubes, it remembered
the pipes of Pan."</p>

<p>"And what did it eat?"</p>

<p>"Pollen and salt."</p>

<p>"Who gave it the food?"</p>

<p>"No one. It was sufficient to inhale the pollen and
salt scattered on the breeze."</p>

<p>"And did it never try to escape?"</p>

<p>"Always. But Seguso took infinite precautions, like
the lover he was."</p>

<p>"And did Ornitio return his love?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it began to love him after a time, particularly
because of the scarlet thread that the master wore continually
around his bare neck."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Perdilanza?"</p>

<p>"She was left alone, and languished in her grief. I
will tell you more of her some day. Some day I shall
go to the seashore of Palestrina, and I will write this
fable for you in the golden sand."</p>

<p>"But how does the story end?"</p>

<p>"The miracle is accomplished. The Archorgan is
raised at Temòdia with its seven thousand glass pipes,
resembling one of those frozen forests which Ornitio&mdash;who
was a little inclined to boast of the wonders it had
met in its travels&mdash;declared it had seen in the land of
the Iporborrei. At last comes the day of the Sensa. The
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Serenissimo</i>, between the Patriarch and the Archbishop of
Spalatro, goes out of the harbor of San Marco on the
<cite>Bucentaur</cite>. So great is the pomp that Ornitio believes it
must be the triumphal return of the son of Chronos. The
fountains are set playing all around Temòdia; and animated
by the eternal silence of the lagoon, the gigantic
organ peals forth, under the magic fingers of the new musicians,
a wave of harmony so vast that it reaches as far
as the mainland and even to the Adriatic. The <cite>Bucentaur</cite>
stops, because its forty oars have suddenly fallen at its
sides, abandoned by the astonished crew. But suddenly
the wave of harmony breaks into discordant sounds, and
at last it dies away in a faint murmur. Dardi feels the instrument
becoming dumb under his fingers, as if his own
soul had failed. What has happened? The master hears
only great shouts of jeers and scorn that come to him
through the silent pipes&mdash;the sound of firing and the
uproar of the populace. A group embarks from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
<cite>Bucentaur</cite>, bringing the red-haired man, who bears a
block and an ax. The blow is aimed exactly at the
scarlet thread; the head falls, and is thrown into the
water, where it floats like the head of Orpheus."</p>

<p>"But what had happened?"</p>

<p>"Perdilanza had thrown herself into the cataract! The
water dragged her into the machinery of the organ.
Her body, with its famous hair, lay across the great
delicate instrument, and silenced its musical heart."</p>

<p>"But Ornitio?"</p>

<p>"Ornitio rescued the head from the water and flew
away with it toward the sea. The swallows heard of
its flight and followed it, and very soon a cloud of black
wings and white surrounds the fugitive. All the nests
in Venice remain empty after this sudden flight."</p>

<p>"And Dardi's head?"</p>

<p>"Where it is, no one knows," concluded the story-teller,
laughing.</p>

<p>The woman bent her head in thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is a hidden meaning in your tale,"
she said, after a pause. "Perhaps I have understood."</p>

<p>"Alas, yes! if there were any resemblance between
my audacity and that of the master workman. Perhaps I
too should wear a scarlet thread around my neck, as a
sort of warning."</p>

<p>"You will have your great destiny. I have no fear
for you."</p>

<p>He ceased to laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend, I must conquer. And you shall help
me. Every morning I too receive my menacing visitor&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
expectation of those that love me and those that
hate me. Expectation should wear the dress of the executioner,
for nothing on earth is so pitiless."</p>

<p>"But it is the measure of your power."</p>

<p>He felt the vulture's beak in his breast. Instinctively
he straightened himself up, seized with an impatience of
even their slow idling on the water. Why did he live
in such idleness? Every hour and every minute he ought
to be trying, struggling, fortifying himself against destruction,
diminution, violation, contagion. Every hour
and every minute his eyes should be fixed on his aim,
and all his energies should be concentrated upon it.</p>

<p>"Do you know this saying of the great Herodotus:
'The name of the bow is Bios, and its work is death'?
This saying is one that excites our spirits even before
communicating to it its exact meaning. I heard it continually
within myself, that evening last autumn, when
I was sitting at your table&mdash;the night of the Epiphany
of the Flame. That night I had an hour of true Dionysian
life, an hour of secret though terrible delight, as if
I held in my breast the burning mountain where the
Tiades howl and shriek. Sometimes I could really
hear songs and clamor, and the cries of distant battle.
It astonished me that I could remain motionless, and
the sense of my bodily immobility increased my mental
frenzy. I could see only your face, which suddenly
appeared extraordinarily beautiful, revealing all the
strength of your soul; and behind it I could see other
countries and other peoples. If I could only tell you how
I saw you! In the tumult, at the passage of marvelous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
images, accompanied by floods of music, I called to you
as in the thick of battle; I made appeals which perhaps
you heard&mdash;not for love alone, but for glory; not
for one thirst, but for two, and I know not which was
the more ardent. And the face of my great work appeared
to me then the same as your face. I saw it, I
tell you! And with incredible rapidity my work took
form in words, song, movement, and symphony, and was
so real that if I succeed in infusing a part of it into that
which I wish to express, I shall surely inflame the
world.</p>

<p>"To express oneself! That is the necessity. The
greatest vision has no value if it is not manifested and
condensed in vital forms. And I have everything to
create. I am not pouring my substance into hereditary
molds. My work is entirely my own invention. I must
not, and I will not, obey anything but my instinct and
the genius of my race. Nevertheless, like Dardi, who
saw the famous organ at the house of Caterino Zeno, I
too have another work before my mind&mdash;a work accomplished
by a formidable creator, a gigantic work in
the eyes of man."</p>

<p>The image of the barbaric creator reappeared to him:
the blue eyes gleamed under the vast forehead, and
he saw once more the white hair tossed by the wind
about that aged neck. He remembered his own indescribable
thrill of joy and fear when he had so unexpectedly
felt beneath his hand the throbbing of that
sacred heart.</p>

<p>"I should say not before but around my spirit. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
it is like a stormy sea trying to draw me down
and swallow me. My Temòdia is a granite rock in the
open sea, and I am like an artisan trying to erect upon
it a pure Doric temple. Compelled to defend the order
of his columns from the violence of the waves, his spirit
is always strained in order never to cease to hear, in
the midst of the clamor, the secret rhythm which alone
must regulate the intervals between lines and spaces.
And in this sense too my tragedy is a battle."</p>

<p>He took one of his friend's hands.</p>

<p>"Do you hear the song?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" she said, raising her face to the sky.
"Is it in heaven or on the earth?"</p>

<p>An infinite melody seemed to be flowing through the
peaceful, silvery atmosphere.</p>

<p>She felt Stelio's hand quiver.</p>

<p>"When Alessandro enters the illuminated chamber
where the virgin has been reading the lament of Antigone,"
he said, "he tells how he has come on horseback
across the plain of Argos, where the song of the larks
fills the sky. He says that one lark fell at his horse's
feet, like a stone, and lay there silent, overcome by
its own frenzy of joy in its song. He picked it up. 'Here
it is.' Then you hold your hand toward him, you take
the bird, and murmur: 'Ah, it is still warm!' And while
you speak the virgin trembles. You can feel her quivering."</p>

<p>The actress felt the mystic chill steal over her once
more, as if the soul of the blind woman reëntered her
own soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>"At the end of the Prelude, the impetuosity of the
chromatic progressions expresses this growing joy, this
fever of delight.... Listen, listen!... Ah,
what a miracle! This morning, Fosca, this morning I
was at work upon my melody, and now it is developing
itself in the air! Are we not in a state of grace?"</p>

<p>A spirit of life seemed indeed running throughout the
solitude; a vehement inspiration filled the silence with
emotion. La Foscarina gave up her whole soul to it,
as a leaf yields itself to the whirlwind, ravished to the
very summit of love and faith.</p>

<p>But a feverish impatience to act, to work, to accomplish
seized the young man. His capacity for work
seemed multiplied. He thought of the plenitude of the
hours to come; he saw his work in concrete form&mdash;the
pages, the scores, the variety of needs, the richness of
material adaptable to rhythm.</p>

<p>"In a week, Fosca, if grace assists me, my Prelude
will be finished, and I should like to try it immediately
with an orchestra. Perhaps I shall go to Rome to do
this. Antimo della Bella is even more impatient than I;
I receive a letter from him almost every day. I believe
that my presence in Rome is necessary for a few days
in order to prevent certain errors that may arise in the
building of the theater. Antimo writes about the possibility
of tearing down the old stone stairs leading
from the Corsini Garden to the Janiculum. The street
that will lead to the theater, after one passes the Arch
of Septimius, will continue beside the Palazzo Corsini,
cross the garden, and extend to the foot of the hill.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
The hill is green and mossy, covered with cypress, laurel,
and flags. The Paulina fountain rises at the left.
A flight of stone steps leads to a terrace from which
open two paths bordered by Apollo-like laurels, and
worthy of leading the people toward Poetry. Can anyone
imagine a nobler entrance? Centuries have wrapped
it in mystery; no sound is heard but the song of birds,
the tinkling of fountains, the whisper of the forest. And
I believe that poets and innocents can even hear there
the fluttering of the Hamadryads and the breath of
Pan!"</p>

<p>The ugly shores, crumbling stones, decaying roots,
traces of ruined buildings, the odor of dissolution, the
funereal cypresses, the black crosses, in vain recalled to
him the words the statues beside the Brenta had spoken
with their marble lips. Only the great song of victory
and liberty, stronger than all other signs, now touched
the heart of him who was to create with joy. "On! on!
Higher! ever higher!"</p>

<p>And the heart of Perdita, purified from all cowardice,
ready for any test, betrothed itself once more to Life!
As in that distant hour of the delirious night, she repeated:
"Let me serve! Let me serve!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
THE WORLD'S BEREAVEMENT</h2>


<p>The gondola entered a canal enclosed between
two green shores, which reached the line of
vision so precisely that the numerous reeds
were perceptible, the newer ones discernible by
their paler tint.</p>

<p>From the fulness of her soul, and the abundance of her
nature, La Foscarina sought everywhere for living
things to love; her glance became child-like once more,
and all things were reflected in it as in the peaceful
water, and some seemed to reappear from the distant
past, like apparitions.</p>

<p>When the gondola touched the shore, she was surprised
at having arrived.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to land, or do you prefer to go back?"
asked Stelio, coming out of his reverie.</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated, because her hand lay in
his, and to move would have meant a lessening of
sweetness.</p>

<p>"Yes," at last she said, with a smile. "Let us walk
on this grass a little while."</p>

<p>They landed on the Island of San Francesco. A few
slender young cypress shrubs greeted them timidly.
Not a human face was to be seen. The invisible myriad
filled the desert with their canticle of praise. The mists
rose in clouds near the sunset hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"How many times we have walked together on the
grass, have we not, Stelio?"</p>

<p>"But now comes the steep rock," he replied.</p>

<p>"Let the rock come, no matter how steep and rough
it may be," said La Foscarina.</p>

<p>Stelio was surprised at the unusual gayety in his companion's
voice. He looked at her, and saw a sort of intoxicated
joy deep in her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"Why do we feel so joyous and free on this lonely
island?"</p>

<p>"And do you know the reason why?"</p>

<p>"To others, this is a melancholy pilgrimage. Most
persons, when they come to this place, leave it with the
taste of death on their lips."</p>

<p>"But we are in a state of grace," said La Foscarina.</p>

<p>"The more we hope, the more we live," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And the more we love, the more we hope."</p>

<p>The rhythm of the aerial song continued, drawing
from them their ideal essences.</p>

<p>"How beautiful you are!" said Stelio.</p>

<p>A sudden flush flowed over that impassioned face.
She was silent, but her breath came quick, and she half-closed
her eyes.</p>

<p>"A warm current of air is passing," she said in a half
whisper. "Did you not feel on the water an occasional
breath of warmer air?"</p>

<p>She drew deep breaths.</p>

<p>"There is an odor like that of new-mown hay. Don't
you detect it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is the odor that comes from the banks of seaweed
that are beginning to be uncovered."</p>

<p>"See how beautiful the country is!"</p>

<p>"That is Le Vignole. Down there is the Lido. And
over there is the Island of Sant' Erasmo."</p>

<p>The sun had now thrown aside its veil and was showering
gold upon the estuary. The damp banks emerging
from the fog suggested the opening of flowers. The
shadows of the slender cypresses began to grow longer
and of a deeper blue.</p>

<p>"I am certain," said La Foscarina, "that almond trees
are in blossom somewhere near. Let us go on the
dyke."</p>

<p>She shook her head, tossing back her hair with one
of those instinctive movements that seemed to break
a bond or to free her of some fetter.</p>

<p>"Wait!"</p>

<p>And quickly withdrawing from her hat two large pins
that held it in place, she uncovered her head. She turned
back to the landing and tossed the sparkling hat into
the gondola; then she rejoined her friend, running her
fingers lightly through the waves of her hair, through
which the air passed, while the sun shone on it warmly.
She seemed to feel relieved, as if she breathed more
freely.</p>

<p>"Did the wings hurt?" Stelio asked with a laugh.</p>

<p>And he regarded the ripples, roughened not by the
comb but by the wind.</p>

<p>"Yes, the least weight annoys me. If I should not
appear eccentric, I should always go without a hat. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
when I see the trees I cannot resist my impulses. My
hair remembers that it was born wild and free, and it
wishes to breathe in its natural way&mdash;in the desert, at
least."</p>

<p>Frank and gay in her manner, she glided over the
grass with her graceful, swaying movement. And Stelio
recalled the day when, in the Gradenigo garden, she had
appeared to his eyes like the beautiful tawny greyhound.</p>

<p>"Oh, here comes a Capuchin!"</p>

<p>The friar-guardian approached them, and greeted
them with affability. He offered to conduct Stelio within
the walls of the monastery, but said that the rules
forbade the admission of his companion.</p>

<p>"Shall I go in?" said Stelio, with a look at La Foscarina,
who was smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, go."</p>

<p>"But you will be all alone."</p>

<p>"Never mind; I will stay here alone."</p>

<p>"I will bring you a bit from the sacred pine."</p>

<p>He followed the friar under the portico with a raftered
roof, whence hung the empty swallows' nests.
Before he crossed the threshold, he turned once more
to wave his hand at his friend. Then the door closed
after him.</p>

O SOLA BEATITUDO!</p>
</div>

<p>Then, as a change in the stops of an organ changes
its whole tone, the woman's thoughts were suddenly
transfigured. The horror of absence, to her the worst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of all evils, bore down upon her loving soul. Her beloved
was no longer there; she no longer heard his voice,
felt his breath, touched his firm and gentle hand. She
no longer saw him live; she could no longer realize
that the air, the lights and shadows, all the life of the
world, harmonized itself with his life!&mdash;Suppose that
door never should open again&mdash;that he never should return
to me!&mdash;No, that could not be. He would surely
cross that threshold again in a few minutes, and once
more she would receive him into her eyes and into her
very soul. But alas! in a few days, would he not thus
disappear again, as he had disappeared now? And first
the field, then the mountain, then other fields and
mountains and rivers, then the strait and the ocean,
the infinite space that neither tears nor cries can cross,
would they not come between her and that brow, those
eyes, those lips? The image of the far-off brutal city
black with coal and bristling with arms, filled the peaceful
island; the crash of hammers, the grinding of wheels,
the puffing of engines, the immense groaning of iron,
drowned the melody of the springtime. And with each
of these simple things&mdash;with the grass, the sands, the
brooks, the seaweed, that soft feather floating downward,
perhaps from the breast of a songbird&mdash;was contrasted
the vision of streets overflowing with the human
torrent, houses with thousands of deformed eyes, full
of fevers that are enemies to sleep, theaters filled with
the restlessness or the stupor of men who yield one
hour to relaxation from the ferocious battle for lucre.
And still, as in a vision, she saw again her own face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and her name on walls contaminated by the leprosy of
posters, on boards carried by stupid bearers, on gigantic
bridges of factories, on the doors of public vehicles, here,
there, and everywhere.</p>

<p>"Look! Look at this! A branch of flowering almond!
There is an almond tree in bloom in the monastery
garden, in the second cloister, near the sacred pine!
And you could detect the odor!"</p>

<p>Stelio ran toward her, joyous as a child, followed by
the Capuchin, who bore a bouquet of fragrant thyme.</p>

<p>"Look! Take it. See what a wonderful thing it is!"</p>

<p>She took the branch, trembling, and her eyes were
bright with tears.</p>

<p>"And you knew it was blooming!" said Stelio.</p>

<p>He perceived the glittering silvery drops in her eyes,
which made them look like the petals of a flower. And
at that instant, of all her adored person, he loved most
blindly the delicate lines that went from the corners
of her eyes to her temples, the tiny veins that made her
eyelids look like violets, the sweet curve of her cheek,
the tapering chin, and all that never would bloom again,
all the shadows of that impassioned face.</p>

<p>"Ah, Father," said she, with a bright glance, repressing
her sadness, "will not Christ's Poor Man weep again
in heaven for this broken branch?"</p>

<p>The friar smiled with playful indulgence.</p>

<p>"When this good gentleman saw our tree," he replied,
"he gave me no time to speak, but had the branch
in his hand in a moment, and I could only say Amen.
But the almond tree is rich."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>He was placid and affable, with a crown of hair still
nearly black, with a refined, olive-skinned face, and great
tawny eyes, as clear as a topaz.</p>

<p>"Here is some savory thyme," he added, offering the
herbs to La Foscarina.</p>

<p>They could hear a choir of youthful voices singing a
Response.</p>

<p>"Those are our novices; we have fifteen with us."</p>

<p>He accompanied the visitors to the meadow behind
the convent. Standing on a bank, at the foot of a blasted
cypress, the good monk pointed to the fertile isles,
praised their abundance, mentioned their varieties of
fruit, lauded the more delightful according to the seasons,
and directed their attention toward the boats sailing
toward the Rialto with their new harvest.</p>

<p>"Praise to Thee, O Lord, for our Mother Earth!" said
the woman with the flowering branch.</p>

<p>The Franciscan was susceptible to the beauty of that
feminine voice, and was silent.</p>

<p>Lofty cypresses encircled the pious field; four of them
showed the marks of lightning strokes. Their tops
were motionless, and were the only sharp outlines in the
level of the meadows, and waters that blended with the
horizon. Not the slightest breeze now stirred the infinite
mirror. A profound enchantment like an ecstasy filled
the lovely place with rapture. The melody of the winged
creatures still continued to float from invisible regions,
but it, too, seemed to begin to flag and soften in this
silent sanctuary.</p>

<p>"At this hour, on the hills of Umbria," said he that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
had despoiled the flowering almond of the cloister,
"every olive-tree has at its base, like a covering that is
shed, a heap of its cut branches; and the tree seems
more beautiful because the heap of branches hides its
rugged roots. Saint Francis passes in the air, and with
his finger he heals the pain of the wounds made by the
pruning-knife."</p>

<p>The Capuchin made the sign of the cross, and took
his leave.</p>

<p>"Praise be to Jesus Christ!"</p>

<p>The visitors watched him as he moved away under
the deep shadows cast by the cypresses.</p>

<p>"He has found peace," said La Foscarina. "Does it
not seem so to you, Stelio? There is great peace in his
face and his voice. Look at his gait, too."</p>

<p>Alternately a ray of light and a bar of shadow fell
across his tonsure and his tunic.</p>

<p>"He gave me a piece of the sacred pine," said Stelio.
"I will send it to Sofia, who is devoted to the seraphic
saint. Here it is. It has no resinous odor now. Smell
it!"</p>

<p>For Sofia's sake she kissed the relic. The lips of the
good sister would touch the spot where she had pressed
her own.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;send it."</p>

<p>Silently they strolled along, their heads bent, in the
footsteps of the man of peace, approaching the landing
between the rows of cypress trees.</p>

<p>"Do you not sometimes wish to see her again?" asked
La Foscarina, with a touch of shyness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, very much," was Stelio's soft-spoken answer.</p>

<p>"And your mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my heart yearns for her&mdash;for that mother who
looks for me each day."</p>

<p>"And would you not like to go back there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall return, perhaps."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"I do not know yet. But I do wish to see once more
my mother and Sofia. I long to see them very much,
Foscarina."</p>

<p>"And why do you not go to them, then? What holds
you here?"</p>

<p>He took the hand that hung idly at her side, and they
continued to walk thus. As the oblique rays of the sun
lighted the right cheek of each, they saw their united
shadows preceding them on the grass.</p>

<p>"When you were speaking of the hills of Umbria
just now," said La Foscarina, "perhaps you were thinking
of the hills of your own part of the country. That
figure of the pruned olive tree was not new to me. I
remember you speaking to me once before of the pruning
of trees. In no other form of his labor can the
farmer gain a deeper sense of the mute life that is in a
tree. When he stands before a pear, an apple, or a peach
tree with the pruning-knife and shears that may increase
their fertility and strength, but which could nevertheless
as easily cause their death, the spirit of divination
surges within him, from the wisdom he has acquired
from his long communings with the earth and the sky.
The tree is at its most delicate moment, when its senses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
are awakened, and the sap is flowing to the buds that
swell and swell, and are just ready to open. And man,
with his pitiless knife, must regulate the mysterious
movement of the sap. The tree is there intact, ignorant
of Hesiod and of Virgil, in labor with its flowering and
its fruit; and every branch in the air is as full of life as
is the arm of the man that wields the knife. Which is
the branch that must be cut off? Will the sap heal
the cut? You told me about your orchard once&mdash;I remember
it. You said that all the cuts should be turned
toward the north, so then the sun should not see them."</p>

<p>She spoke as she had spoken in that far-off evening
in November, when the young man had arrived at her
house, breathless from the tempest of wind, after he had
borne the hero in his arms.</p>

<p>He smiled, and let himself be led by that dear hand.
He inhaled the fragrance of that flowery branch in which
was a suggestion of bitterness.</p>

<p>"It is true," he said. "And Laimo would prepare the
ointment of Saint Fiacre in the mortar, and Sofia would
bring him the strong linen to bandage the larger wounds,
after they had been cleansed."</p>

<p>In fancy he could see the kneeling peasant, pounding
cow-dung, clay, and barley-husks in a stone mortar,
according to an ancient recipe.</p>

<p>"In ten days," he continued, "the whole hill, seen
from the seas, will be like a great pink cloud. Sofia
wrote to remind me of it. Has she ever reappeared to
you?"</p>

<p>"She is with us now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is now standing at the window, looking out at
the purpling sea; and our mother, leaning on the window-ledge
with her, says to her: 'Who knows whether
Stelio may not be on that sail boat which I see waiting
at the mouth of the river for the wind? He promised
me he would return unexpectedly by sea, in a small
boat.'&mdash;And then her heart aches."</p>

<p>"Ah, why do you disappoint her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Fosca, you are right. But I can live far-away
from her for months and months, yet feel that my life
is full. Then&mdash;an hour comes when nothing in the world
appears to me so sweet as her dear eyes and there
is a part of myself that remains inconsolable. I have
heard the sailors of the Tyrrhenean Sea call the Adriatic
the Gulf of Venice. To-night I remember that my
house is on the Gulf, and that seems to bring it nearer
to me."</p>

<p>They had reached the gondola once more, but turned
to look back at the isle of prayer, where grew the tall
cypresses with their imploring arms.</p>

<p>"Over yonder is the canal of the Tre Porti that leads
to the open sea," said the homesick one, fancying that
he could see himself standing on the deck of the little
brig, in sight of his tamarisks and myrtles.</p>

<p>They reëmbarked, and floated away, silent for a long
time. The aerial melody still fell softly on the archipelago.</p>

<p>"Now that the plan of your work is finished," said La
Foscarina, beginning again her gentle persuasion,
though her heart trembled in her breast, "you will need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
peace and quiet for your labor upon it. Have you not
always worked best at your home? In no other place
will you be able to soothe the restless anxiety that
possesses you. I know it well."</p>

<p>"That is true," he replied. "When the yearning for
glory seizes us, we believe that the conquest of art must
be like the siege of a fortification, and that trumpets
and shouts accompany the courageous assault; while in
reality the only work that is of real value is that which
has been developed in austere silence&mdash;work performed
with slow, indomitable perseverance, in hard, pure solitude.
Nothing is of any value save the complete
abandonment of soul and body to the Idea which we
desire to establish among men as a permanent and
dominating force."</p>

<p>"Ah, you know it, too!"</p>

<p>The woman's eyes were filled with tears again, at the
sound of those inexorable words, in which was expressed
the depth of virile passion, the heroic necessity of mental
domination, the firm determination to surpass himself
and to force his destiny without flinching.</p>

<p>"Yes, you know it well!"</p>

<p>And she was thrilled, as one that beholds a noble
spectacle; and, contemplating that embodied force of
will, all else appeared vain to her. The tears she had
felt in her eyes when he had brought her the flowering
branch now seemed mean and weakly effeminate in
comparison with those that in this moment welled up
and were alone worthy to be kissed away by her friend.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, then&mdash;go back to your sea, to your own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
countryside, to your own home. Light your lamp once
more with the oil of your own olives."</p>

<p>Stelio's lips were closely compressed, and a deep
frown wrinkled his brow.</p>

<p>"The dear sister will come to your side again to lay
a blade of grass on the difficult page."</p>

<p>He bent his brow, which was clouded with a thought.</p>

<p>"You will rest in talking with Sofia by the window;
and perhaps you will see again the flocks of sheep on
their way from the plain to the mountains."</p>

<p>The sunlight was approaching the gigantic acropolis
of the Dolomites. The phalanx of clouds was disordered
as if in battle, pierced by innumerable darts of
light, and steeped in a marvelous blood-like crimson.</p>

<p>Slowly, after a long silence, Stelio spoke:</p>

<p>"And if she should ask me about the fate of the virgin
who reads the lament of Antigone?"</p>

<p>La Foscarina started.</p>

<p>"And suppose she asks me about the love of the
brother who searches through the tombs?"</p>

<p>The woman felt a dread of this phantom.</p>

<p>"And suppose the page on which she lays the blade
of grass were the page wherein that trembling soul
tells of its secret and terrible battle against the horrible
evil?"</p>

<p>In her sudden terror, the woman could find no words.
Both relapsed into silence, looking long at the sharp
peaks of the distant mountains, which glowed as if just
emerging from primordial fire. The spectacle of this
eternally desolate grandeur awakened in them a sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of mysterious fatality and a certain confused terror
which they could neither conquer nor comprehend.</p>

<p>"And you?" said Stelio suddenly, after a long silence.</p>

<p>La Foscarina made no reply.</p>

<p>The bells of San Marco sounded the signal for the
Angelus, and their tremendous clamor swelled in ever-widening
waves over the still crimson lagoon which they
were leaving to the memories of shadows and death.
From San Giorgio Maggiore and San Giorgio dei Greci,
from San Giorgio degli Schiavoni and San Giovanni in
Bragora, from San Moisé, from the Salute, the Redentore,
and, from one place to another, throughout the
whole domain of the Evangelists, even to the distant
towers of the Madonna dell' Orto, of San Giobbe and
Sant' Andrea, the bronze voices answered, mingling in
one great chorus floating over the silent stones and
waters, a veritable dome of sound, invisible, yet the vibrations
of which seemed to communicate with the scintillation
of the first stars. And the reverberation above
the heads of the two in the gondola was so great that
they seemed to feel it in the roots of their hair and in
the cool shiver of their flesh.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that you, Daniele?"</p>

<p>Stelio had recognized at the door of his own house,
on the Fondamenta Samedo, the figure of Daniele
Glauro.</p>

<p>"Ah, Stelio, I have been waiting for you!" cried
Daniele breathlessly, striving to make himself heard
above the pealing of bells. "Richard Wagner is dead!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
THE LAST FAREWELL</h2>


<p>All the world seemed to have diminished in
value.</p>

<p>The nomad woman had armed herself anew
with courage, and planned the route of her
next professional tour. From the thought of the hero
lying in his coffin, a lofty inspiration came to all noble
hearts. La Foscarina knew how to receive it and to
convert it to the thoughts and actions of daily life.</p>

<p>It happened that her beloved surprised her at the
time she was packing her familiar books, the little cherished
treasures from which she never parted&mdash;things that
for her possessed the power of imparting dreams or consolation.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Stelio asked.</p>

<p>"I am making ready to leave the country."</p>

<p>She saw a change pass over his face, but she did not
waver.</p>

<p>"And where are you going?"</p>

<p>"A long distance from here&mdash;I shall cross the Atlantic."</p>

<p>Stelio became slightly paler. But suddenly he was
seized with doubt; he thought she was not speaking
the truth; that she wished only to prove him; that her
decision was not absolutely fixed, and that she expected
to be persuaded to remain. The unlooked-for disillusion
on the banks of Murano had left its mark on his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you really decided on this, then, so suddenly?"</p>

<p>She was simple, sure of herself, and prompt in her
reply.</p>

<p>"My decision is not exactly sudden. My idleness has
lasted too long, and I have the responsibility of all my
company on my shoulders. While I am waiting for the
Theater of Apollo to be opened, and for <cite>The Victory
of Man</cite> to be finished, I shall go once more to bid farewell
to the Barbarians. I must work for your beautiful
enterprise. We shall need a great deal of gold to restore
the treasures of Mycenæ. And all that is connected with
your work must appear with unrivaled magnificence.
I do not wish Cassandra's mask to be of some base metal.
But, above all, I wish to satisfy your desire that for the
first three days the populace shall have free admission
to the theater, and after that on one day of every week.
My faith aids me to leave you. Time flies. It is necessary
that each person should be in his own place, ready
and full of strength, when the great day comes. I shall
not fail you. I hope that you will be satisfied with your
friend. I am going away to work, and certainly the task
will be more difficult than I ever have found it before.
But you, my poor boy, what a burden you have to bear!
What an effort we demand from you! What great
things we expect from you! Ah, you know it!"</p>

<p>She had begun courageously, in a tone that was almost
blithe, trying to seem what above all she must be&mdash;a
good and faithful instrument at the service of a powerful
genius, a strong and willing companion. But a
wave of repressed emotion would rise in her throat and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
stop her speech. Her pauses grew longer, and her hand
wandered uncertainly among her books and treasures.</p>

<p>"May everything be ever propitious to your work!
That is the only thing that really matters&mdash;all else is
nothing. Let us lift our hearts!"</p>

<p>She shook her head, with its two wild wings, and held
out both hands to her beloved. He, pale and grave,
clasped them close. In her dear eyes, that were like
sparkling springs of water, he saw a flash of the same
beauty that had dazzled him one evening in the room
where the fire had roared, and he had listened to the development
of the two great melodies.</p>

<p>"I love you and I have faith in you," he said; "I will
not fail you and you will not fail me. Something springs
from us that shall be stronger than life itself."</p>

<p>"A great melancholy," she answered.</p>

<p>Before her, on a table, lay the familiar book, with
pages turned down and margins full of scribbled notes;
here and there a petal, a flower, a blade of grass lay
between the leaves&mdash;signs of the sorrow that had asked
and obtained from them the consolation of relief or of
forgetfulness. Before her were strewn all the little
cherished objects dear to her, strange, varied; nearly all
were things of no value: a doll's foot, a silver heart, an
ivory compass, a watch without a dial, a small iron lantern,
a single earring, a flint, a key, a seal, and other
trifles; but all were consecrated by some memory, animated
by some superstitious belief, touched by the finger
of love or of death, relics that could speak only to one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of war and of truce, of hope and of sadness. Among
these objects were figures to which artists had entrusted
their secret confession, signs and enigmas, profound allegories,
hiding truths that, like the sun, could not be
gazed at by mortal eyes.</p>

<p>The young man put his arm around his friend's waist,
and silently they went to the window. They saw the
far-distant sky, the trees, the towers, the end of the
lagoon over which Twilight was bending her face, while
the Euganean hills were as quiet and blue as if they
were the wings of earth folded in the peacefulness of
eventide.</p>

<p>They turned toward each other, looking into the
depths of each other's eyes. Then they embraced, as
if to seal a silent compact.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yes, all the world seemed to have diminished in value.</p>

<p>Stelio Effrena had asked of the widow of Richard
Wagner that the two young Italian men that had carried
the unconscious hero from the vessel to the shore
that night in November, with four of their friends,
might have granted to them the honor of bearing the
coffin from the death-chamber to the boat and from
the boat to the hearse. This request was granted.</p>

<p>It was the sixteenth of February, at one o'clock in
the afternoon. Stelio Effrena, Daniele Glauro, Francesco
de Lizo, Baldassare Stampa, Fabio Molza, and
Antimo della Bella waited in the hall of the palace.
The latter had come from Rome, bringing with him
the artisans engaged in the building of the Theater of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Apollo, that they might bear at the funeral ceremony
bunches of laurel gathered on the Janiculum.</p>

<p>They waited in silence, without even looking at one
another, each overcome by the throbbing of his own
heart. Nothing was heard save a faint dropping of
water on the steps before the great door, where, on the
candelabra at the doorposts appeared the two words:
DOMUS PACIS.</p>

<p>The boatman, who had been dear to the hero, came
to call them. In that rough yet faithful face, the eyes
showed that the lids were burned by weeping.</p>

<p>Stelio Effrena advanced first, followed by his companions.
After ascending the stairs, they entered a low-studded,
darkened room, filled with the melancholy odor
of flowers and fluids. They paused there a few minutes.
A door opened. They passed through the doorway one
by one into the next room. Each turned pale as he
entered.</p>

<p>The body was there, enclosed in its crystal coffin,
and beside it stood the woman with the face of snowy
pallor. The second coffin, of polished metal, stood shining
on the floor.</p>

<p>The six bearers ranged themselves about the coffin,
awaiting a sign. The silence was profound, and no
one moved; but an impetuous sadness shook each soul
like a tempest of wind.</p>

<p>Each gazed on the elect of Life and of Death. An
infinite smile illumined the face of the hero lying there&mdash;infinite
and distant as the glint of a glacier, as the
sparkle of the sea, as the halo of the star. Their eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
could not bear to look long at it, but their hearts, with
an awe-struck fear that made them religious, felt as if
they had the revelation of a divine secret.</p>

<p>The woman with the snow-white face made a slight
movement, yet preserved the same attitude, rigid as a
statue.</p>

<p>Then the six friends approached the body, extended
their arms, summoned up their strength. Stelio Effrena
took his place at the head and Daniele Glauro took his
at the feet, as on that day in November. The young
men lifted their burden with one movement, at a low-spoken
word from the leader. The eyes of each were
dazzled, as if a sudden ray of sunlight had pierced the
crystal. Baldassare Stampa broke into sobs. The same
knot was in each throat. The coffin swayed, then it was
lowered into its metal covering, which enveloped it like
a suit of armor.</p>

<p>The six friends remained overcome with grief. They
hesitated to put the cover in its place, fascinated by that
infinite smile. Stelio Effrena heard a light rustling, and
looked up. He saw the white face bending over the
body, a superhuman apparition of love and grief. That
instant was like eternity. The woman disappeared.</p>

<p>When the coffin was closed, they lifted their burden
a second time&mdash;heavier now. Out of the room and down
the stairs they bore it slowly. Rapt in a kind of sublime
anguish, they could see their fraternal faces reflected
in the polished metal.</p>

<p>The funeral barge awaited them at the entrance. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
pall was laid over the coffin. The six friends waited,
with heads uncovered, for the family to descend. They
came, all together. The widow passed them, veiled.
But the splendor of her face would remain in their
memories forever.</p>

<p>The procession was short; the funeral barge went first,
followed by the widow with her relatives; then came
the young men. The sky was cloudy above the broad
road of stone and water. The deep silence was worthy
of Him who transformed the forces of the universe for
man's worship into infinite song.</p>

<p>A flock of doves, flying from the marbles of the Scalsi,
winged their way with a flash of plumage above the bier
and across the canal, circling the cupola of San Simeone.</p>

<p>At the quay a silent gathering of faithful friends was
waiting. The large wreaths perfumed the air. The
water rippled softly under the prows of the boats. The
six companions lifted the coffin from the boat and bore
it on their shoulders to the railway and placed it in the
proper compartment. No one spoke.</p>

<p>Then the two artisans from Rome came forward, with
the clusters of laurel gathered on the Janiculum. They
were tall, powerful men, chosen among the strongest
and finest, and seemed cast in the mold of the ancient
Roman race. They were calm and serious, with all the
wild freedom of the Agro in their eyes. Their bold outlines,
narrow foreheads, short curling hair, solid jaws
and bull-necks, recalled the profiles of ancient consuls.
Their bearing, free from any servile obsequiousness,
showed them to be worthy of their function.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>The six young men, rendered equal in their fervor,
took the branches of laurel and strewed them over the
hero's coffin.</p>

<p>Noble were those Latin laurels, cut on the hill where,
in a time long past, the eagles descended bearing prophecies;
where, in more recent though still fabulous times,
a river of blood has been shed for the beauty of Italy by
the legions of the Liberator. The branches were straight,
dark, and strong; the leaves were firm, deeply veined,
with sharp edges, green as the bronze of fountains, rich
with triumphal aroma.</p>

<p>And they journeyed toward the Bavarian hill still sleeping
beneath its frost and ice, while their trunks were
already budding anew in the light of Rome, to the murmur
of invisible waters.</p>
